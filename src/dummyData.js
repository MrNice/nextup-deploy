Moore has been selected as the new dean of Carnegie Mellon University&#x2019;s renowned School of Computer Science (SCS), effective this August. Moore, a distinguished computer scientist with expertise in machine learning and robotics, served as a professor of computer science and robotics at CMU before being named founding director of Google&#x2019;s Pittsburgh engineering office in 2006. &#xA0;</p><p>Moore&#x2019;s appointment adds further momentum to President Suresh&#x2019;s initiatives aimed at enhancing the connections among CMU&#x2019;s world-renowned research, its innovative and entrepreneurial culture, and expanding interactions with industry and government.&#xA0; Carnegie Mellon&#x2019;s pioneering leadership in computer technologies, seamlessly leveraged with its expertise in the sciences, engineering, arts, design, policy, business and humanities, provides significant opportunities for shaping the 21<sup>st</sup> century in which computing and data are poised to play a transformative role in the daily lives of billions of global citizens.</p><p>&#x201C;Andrew Moore combines an expansive vision, scientific expertise, and leadership strength that make him extraordinarily well suited to be dean of the School of Computer Science,&#x201D; said Carnegie Mellon President Subra Suresh. &#x201C;As computing grows ever more critical to our global society, the scope of SCS and its importance to the world will continue to expand and its impact on the human condition will be more evident. Andrew is particularly well positioned to lead the School at this time.&#x201D;</p><p>SCS is known for its breadth of focus; faculty research includes not only the creation of better computer hardware and software, but also studies of the diverse effects of computing on society and the world.&#xA0; Google opened its Pittsburgh office on CMU&#x2019;s campus in 2006 to gain proximity to its computer science talent. &#xA0;</p><p>\"Andrew Moore has been a respected contributor to Google and the Pittsburgh community since he helped start the office there in 2006,\" said Eric Schmidt, Executive Chairman of Google Inc., a former member of the CMU Board of Trustees and the keynote speaker at Suresh&#x2019;s inauguration last November as the ninth president of Carnegie Mellon. \"Some of Google's strongest talent has come out of CMU, and we look forward to continuing our relationship with the university. I know Andrew will help inspire the next generation of innovators.\"</p><p>Moore&#x2019;s research ranges from improving manufacturing methods and finding distant asteroids in space to early detection of bioterrorism using data on over-the-counter medication purchases.&#xA0; His CMU-based research group, the Auton Lab, collaborates closely with other scientists, government agencies and technology companies. Auton Lab algorithms are now in use in dozens of commercial, university and government applications.</p><p>&#xA0;&#x201C;Ever since college I have been inspired by the world-changing ideas and technologies that come out of CMU. I&#x2019;m privileged to return to the School of Computer Science in this new role,&#x201D; said Andrew Moore. &#x201C;I have had a wonderful 8 years at Google Pittsburgh: a place which I believe has the most creative and driven gang of computer scientists in the world. We plan to remain great friends within the broader context of growing Pittsburgh&#x2019;s leadership in science and technology.&#x201D;</p><p>Under Moore&#x2019;s leadership, Google Pittsburgh has grown to hundreds of employees. Moore led essential engineering contributions to Google&#x2019;s services, including AdWords, Shopping and Search, as well as core Google engineering infrastructure and tools. Since 2010, the company has annually been among Carnegie Mellon&#x2019;s largest employers, with more than 500 alumni now working for the company worldwide.</p><p><em>Carnegie Mellon&#x2019;s School of Computer Science</em></p><p>Celebrating its 25<sup>th</sup> anniversary this year, SCS is widely regarded as one of the best computer science programs in the world. U.S. News and World Report has ranked CMU&#x2019;s graduate program in computer science No. 1 since 2011. &#xA0;CMU faculty have made groundbreaking contributions to search engines, network security, life-saving robots, driverless cars, computer vision, language processing and technologies for learning.&#xA0; CMU scholars Alan Perlis, Allen Newell and Nobel Prize winner Herbert Simon were among the founding fathers of the discipline of computer science.&#xA0; Moreover, CMU is home to 12 winners of the Turing Award, the highest honor in computer science research.</p><p>Faculty and students at SCS have developed some of the world&#x2019;s best known and most frequently used technologies from CAPTCHA web security tests to kidney donor matching methods and the 2013 App of the Year, &#x201C;Duolingo&#x201D;. The first emoticon, known as &#x201C;Smiley&#x201D;&#xA0; :-), was created at CMU.&#xA0; In</p><p>addition, SCS gave birth to technologies such as the GigaPan camera system, a robotic device that allows any camera to shoot multibillion-pixel panoramic images; Alice, a software platform developed to teach students computer programming by creating 3D animations and video games; and the Mach kernel that lies at the heart of Apple&#x2019;s primary operating system, OS X. It is also where robots have been created to clean up nuclear waste, travel to places humans cannot reach and to assist with minimally invasive surgery.&#xA0;</p><p>Moore received a doctorate from the University of Cambridge in 1991 and joined the CMU faculty in 1993 following two years of post-doctoral research. In 2005, he was elected a fellow of the American Association for Artificial Intelligence. Andrew lives in Pittsburgh with his wife, Mary, and two children, William and Lucy. &#xA0;</p><p>Moore succeeds Randal E. Bryant, who will return to the CMU faculty after serving as dean since 2004. &#xA0;</p>   \n\t\t<div class=\"keywords\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"field field-name-field-for-more-information field-type-text field-label-above\"><p class=\"field-label\">For More Information:&#xA0;</p><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p>Ken Walters | 412-268-1151 | <a href=\"http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k=01W5ruucKgCJs6qKvrLMliNw==&amp;c=kZA41dSePUY5nghZjYDxOCj_EyCHm5gOodDpbio_DRs=\" title=\"Reveal this e-mail address\">[Click to Reveal Email]</a></p></div></div></div></div>\n   \n  </div>\n  \n  </div>","related":{}},"1":{"title":"http://debug.elm-lang.org/","content":"<div></div>","related":{}},"2":{"title":"http://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2014/04/cheap-microscopes","content":"<div><div class=\"blog-title babbage\"> <img class=\"imagefield imagefield-field_blog_logo\" width=\"144\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/blog_sites/_0000s_0018_babage.png?1328719137\">  </div> <div class=\"main-content\"> <div class=\"content-image-full\"> <img src=\"http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/full-width/images/2014/04/blogs/babbage/20140419_stp502_0.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" width=\"595\"> </div><p>IF EVER a technology were ripe for disruption, it is the microscope. Benchtop microscopes have remained essentially unchanged since the 19th century&#x2014;their shape a cartoonist&#x2019;s clich&#xE9; of science akin to alchemical glassware and Bunsen burners. And that lack of change has costs. Microscopes are expensive (several hundred dollars for a reasonable one) and need to be serviced and maintained. Unfortunately, one important use of them is in poor-world laboratories and clinics, for identifying pathogens, and such places often have small budgets and lack suitably trained technicians.</p><p>That, thinks Manu Prakash, a bioengineer at Stanford University, provides an opening for a bit of lateral thinking. And Dr Prakash&#x2019;s mental sideways movement has led him to design a microscope made almost entirely of paper, which is so cheap that the question of servicing it goes out of the window.</p><p>Individual Foldscopes, as Dr Prakash dubs them, are printed on A4 sheets of paper (ideally polymer-coated for durability). A pattern of perforations on the sheet marks out the &#x2019;scope&#x2019;s components, which are colour-coded in a way intended to assist the user in the task of assembly&#x2014;for the Foldscope has no written instructions to guide, or possibly frustrate, the user.</p><p>The Foldscope&#x2019;s non-paper components, a poppy-seed-sized spherical lens made of borosilicate or corundum, a light-emitting diode (LED), a watch battery, a switch and some copper tape to complete the electrical circuit, are pressed into or bonded onto the paper. (The lenses are actually bits of abrasive grit intended to roll around in tumblers that smooth-off metal parts.) A high-resolution version of this costs less than a dollar, and offers a magnification of up to 2,100 times and a resolving power of less than a micron. A lower-spec version (up to 400x magnification) costs less than 60 cents.</p><p>The whole device weighs less than 10 grams, can fit in someone&#x2019;s pocket, requires no external power and takes standard microscope slides. Sliding and flexing the Foldscope&#x2019;s struts with thumb and fingers (see picture) lets the user move a slide around and then focus on the relevant bit of it. The Foldscope can be adapted, by fitting it with a more powerful LED, to project what it sees onto a screen, and the design can be modified to accommodate multiple lenses or filters. Dunk it in water, drop it from a rooftop or stamp on it (though not with a slide inside), and it will still work.</p><p>Dr Prakash sees the Foldscope&#x2019;s main use as a diagnostic tool for tropical diseases. Malaria, for example, can be caused by several species of parasite. Knowing which is responsible in a particular case can affect the treatment chosen. Foldscopes should also help diagnose other widespread diseases, such as schistosomiasis, loiasis and sleeping sickness.</p><p>He hopes, too, that they will help enthuse the next generation of doctors and scientists. To this end he and his team have drummed up more than 10,000 people from 130 countries to devise simple, relevant microscopy-based experiments. A Mongolian farmer, for instance, wants to show his fellows why they should boil milk to make it safer. An American beekeeper proposes to use Foldscopes to show his fellow apiculturalists how to identify bee-killing mites and fungi. And a 12-year-old Qatari would like to study the Namib desert beetle, which scavenges drinking water from morning fogs. The results, when published on the web, will become part of a manual of microscopy for everyman (and woman) that Dr Prakash hopes will encourage yet more experimentation.</p></div> </div>","related":{}},"3":{"title":"GCC Explorer","content":"<div>\n        <div class=\"navbar navbar-fixed-top\">\n            <div class=\"navbar-inner\">\n                <div class=\"container-fluid\">\n                    <a class=\"brand\" href=\"http://gcc.godbolt.org/\">Interactive compiler</a>\n                    <ul class=\"nav pull-right\"><li class=\"dropdown\">\n                            <a href=\"http://gcc.godbolt.org/\" class=\"dropdown-toggle\">Share<b class=\"caret\"></b></a>\n                            <ul class=\"dropdown-menu\"><li class=\"social\"><plusone width=\"150\"></plusone></li>\n                                <li class=\"social\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\">Tweet</a>\n                                </li>\n                            </ul></li>\n                        <li><a href=\"mailto:matt@godbolt.org\">Contact me</a></li>\n                    </ul></div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <section id=\"main\" class=\"container-fluid\"><div class=\"row-fluid\">\n            <div class=\"span6\">\n                \n                    <p>\n                        <label>Source: </label>\n                        <label>Name: </label>\n                    </p>\n                    <div class=\"btn-group\">\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        <a class=\"btn permalink\" href=\"http://gcc.godbolt.org/\">Permalink</a>\n                    </div>\n                \n            </div>\n            <div class=\"span6\">\n                \n                    <label>Compiler: </label>\n                    <label>Compiler options: </label>\n                    <table><tbody><tr><td>Filter:Â </td>\n                    <td>\n                        \n                    </td></tr></tbody></table>\n            </div>\n       </div>\n        <div class=\"row-fluid\">\n            <div class=\"span6 editor\">\n                <p class=\"topbar indented\">C++ editor</p>\n                </div>\n            <div class=\"span6 asm\">\n                <p class=\"topbar indented\">Assembly output</p>\n                </div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"row result\">\n            <p class=\"topbar\">Compiler output</p>\n            <div class=\"output span12\">\n                \n            </div>\n        </div>\n        </section><div class=\"modal hide\" id=\"saveDialog\">\n            <p class=\"modal-header\">\n                \n                <h3>Save as...</h3>\n            </p>\n            <p class=\"modal-body\">\n                <label>Filename: </label>\n            </p>\n            <div class=\"modal-footer\">\n                <a href=\"http://gcc.godbolt.org/\" class=\"btn\">Cancel</a>\n                <a href=\"http://gcc.godbolt.org/\" class=\"btn btn-primary save\">Save</a>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/mattgodbolt/gcc-explorer\"><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/github/ribbons/forkme_right_green_007200.png\" alt=\"Fork me on GitHub\"></a>\n    </div>","related":{}},"4":{"title":"The Truth About Google X: An Exclusive Look Behind The Secretive Lab's Closed Doors","content":"<div><div class=\"body prose twelve columns\">\n      <p>Astro Teller is sharing a story about something bad. Or maybe it's something good. At Google X, it's sometimes hard to know the difference.</p>\n\n<p>Teller is the scientist who directs day-to-day work at the search &#xAD;giant's intensely private innovation lab, which is devoted to finding unusual solutions to huge global problems. He isn't the president or chairman of X, however; his actual title, as his etched-glass business card proclaims, is Captain of Moonshots--\"moonshots\" being his catchall description for audacious innovations that have a slim chance of succeeding but might revolutionize the world if they do. It is evening in Mountain View, California, dinnertime in a noisy restaurant, and Teller is recounting over the din how earlier in the day he had to give some unwelcome news to his bosses, Google cofounder Sergey Brin and CFO Patrick Pichette. \"It was a complicated meeting,\" says Teller, 43, sighing a bit. \"I was telling them that one of our groups was having a hard time, that we needed to course-correct, and that it was going to cost some money. Not a trivial amount.\" Teller's financial team was worried; so was he. But Pichette listened to the problem and essentially said, \"Thanks for telling me as soon as you knew. We'll make it work.\"</p>\n\n<p>At first, it seems Teller's point is that the tolerance for setbacks at Google X is uncharacteristically high--a situation helped along by his bosses' zeal for the work being done there and by his parent company's extraordinary, almost ungodly, profitability. But this is actually just part of the story. There happens to be a slack line--a low tightrope--slung between trees outside the Google X offices. After the meeting, the three men walked outside, took off their shoes, and gave the line a go for 20&#xA0;minutes. Pichette is quite good at walking back and forth; Brin slightly less so; Teller not at all. But they all took turns balancing on the rope, falling frequently, and getting back on. The slack line is groin-high. \"It looked like a fail video from YouTube,\" Teller says. And that's really his message here. \"When these guys are willing to fall, groan, and get up--and they're in their socks?\" He leans back and pauses, as if to say: This is the essence of Google X. When the leadership can fail in full view, \"then it gives everyone permission to be more like that.\"</p>\n\n<p>Failure is not precisely the goal at Google X. But in many respects it is the means. By the time Teller and I speak, I have spent most of the day inside his lab, which no journalist has previously been allowed to explore. Throughout the morning and afternoon I visited a variety of work spaces and talked at length with members of the Google X Rapid Evaluation Team, or \"Rapid Eval,\" as they're known, about how they vet ideas and test out the most promising ones, primarily by doing everything humanly and technologically possible to make them fall apart. Rapid Eval is the start of the innovative process at X; it is a method that emphasizes rejecting ideas much more than affirming them. That is why it seemed to me that X--which is what those who work there usually call it--sometimes resembled a cult of failure. As Rich DeVaul, the head of Rapid Eval, says: \"Why put off failing until tomorrow or next week if you can fail now?\" Over dinner, Teller tells me he sometimes gives a hug to people who admit mistakes or defeat in group meetings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>X does not employ your typical Silicon Valley types. Google already has a large lab division, Google Research, that is devoted mainly to computer science and Internet technologies. The distinction is sometimes framed this way: Google Research is mostly bits; Google X is mostly atoms. In other words, X is tasked with making actual objects that interact with the physical world, which to a certain extent gives logical coherence to the four main projects that have so far emerged from X: driverless cars, Google Glass, high-&#xAD;altitude Wi-Fi balloons, and glucose-monitoring contact lenses. Mostly, X seeks out people who want to build stuff, and who won't get easily daunted. Inside the lab, now more than 250 &#xAD;employees strong, I met an idiosyncratic troupe of former park rangers, sculptors, philosophers, and machinists; one X scientist has won two Academy Awards for special effects. Teller himself has written a novel, worked in finance, and earned a PhD in artificial intelligence. One recent hire spent five years of his evenings and weekends building a helicopter in his garage. It actually works, and he flew it regularly, which seems insane to me. But his technology skills alone did not get him the job. The helicopter did. \"The classic definition of an expert is someone who knows more and more about less and less until they know everything about nothing,\" says DeVaul. \"And people like that can be extremely useful in a very focused way. But these are really not X people. What we want, in a sense, are people who know less and less about more and more.\"</p>\n\n<p>If there's a master plan behind X, it's that a frictional arrangement of ragtag intellects is the best hope for creating products that can solve the world's most intractable issues. Yet Google X, as Teller describes it, is an experiment in itself--an effort to reconfigure the process by which a corporate lab functions, in this case by taking incredible risks across a wide variety of technological domains, and by not hesitating to stray far from its parent company's business. We don't yet know if this will prove to be genius or folly. There's actually no historical model, no &#xAD;precedent, for what these people are doing.</p>\n\n<p>But in some ways that makes sense. Google finds itself at a juncture in history that has not come before, and may not come again. The company is almost unimaginably rich and stocked with talent; it is hitting its peak of influence at a moment when networks and computing power and artificial intelligence are coalescing in what many technologists describe as (to borrow the Valley's most popular meme) \"the second machine age.\" In addition, it is trying hard to develop another huge core business to augment its massive search division. So why not do it through X? To Teller, this failure-loving lab has simply stepped into the breach. Small companies don't feel they have the resources to take moonshots. Big companies think it'll rattle shareholders. Government leaders believe there's not enough money, or that Congress will characterize a misstep or failure as a scandal. These days, when it comes to Hail Mary innovation, \"Everyone thinks it's somebody's else's job,\" Teller says.</p>\n\n<p>It is worth noting that X's moonshots are not as purely altruistic as Google likes to make them sound. While self-driving cars will almost certainly save lives, for instance, they will also free up drivers to do web searches and use Gmail. Wi-Fi balloons could result in a billion more Google users. Still, it's hard not to appreciate that these ideas, along with others coming from X, are breathtakingly idealistic. When I ask Teller why Google has chosen to invest in X rather than something that might appeal more to Wall Street, he dismisses the premise. Then he cracks a smile. \"That's a false choice,\" he says. \"Why do we have to pick?\"</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Google X is situated at</strong> the edge of the Google campus, housed mostly in a couple of three-story red-brick buildings. The lab has no sign in front, just as it has no official website (\"What would we put on the website, anyway?\" Teller asks). The main building's entrance leads into a small, self-serve coffee bar. The aesthetic is modern, austere, &#xAD;industrial. To the left is a cavernous room with dozens of cubicles and several conference rooms; to the right is a bike rack and a lunchroom with a stern warning posted that only X employees are allowed. Otherwise, there's little indication you're in a supersecret lab. Most of the collaborative workshops are downstairs, in high-ceilinged rooms with whimsical names such as \"Castle Grayskull,\" and are cluttered with electronic paraphernalia and Xers bent over laptops.</p>\n\n<p>The origins of X date to around 2009, when Brin and Google &#xAD;cofounder Larry Page conceived of a position called Director of Other; this person would oversee ideas far from Google's core search business. This notion evolved into X around 2010, thanks to Google engineer Sebastian Thrun's effort, backed by Brin and Page, to build a driverless car. The X lab grew up around that endeavor, with Thrun in charge. Thrun chose Teller as one of his codirectors, but when Thrun was drawn deeper into developing the car technology (and later into his online educational startup, &#xAD;Udacity), he gave up on overseeing other X projects. That's when Teller assumed day-to-day responsibilities.</p>\n\n<p>There are differing explanations for what the X actually stands for. At first it was simply a placeholder for a better name, but these days it usually denotes the search for solutions that are better by a factor of 10. Some of the Xers I met, however, think of the X as representing an organization willing to build technologies that are 10 years away from making a large impact.</p>\n\n<p>This in itself is fairly unique. Once upon a time, corporate labs invested a chunk of their R&amp;D budget in risky, long-term projects, but an increasing focus on quarterly earnings, and the realization that it can be exceedingly hard to recoup an investment in far-off research, ended almost all such efforts. These days, it's considered more sensible for a company to fund short-term research--or if it wants to think far into the future, to either buy rights to an embryonic idea that arises from university research or a government lab, or to swallow up an innovative startup. Teller and Brin are not averse to doing this; for example, the wind-energy company Makani was recently bought by Google and folded into X. But Google and X have often rejected the conventional business wisdom in favor of hatching their own wild-eyed research schemes, and then waiting patiently for them to mature. Recently, when Page was challenged on an earnings call about the sums he was pouring into X, he made no effort to excuse it. \"My struggle in general is to get people to spend money on long-term R&amp;D,\" he said, noting that the amounts he was investing were modest in light of Google's profits. Then he chided the financial community: Shouldn't they be asking him to make more big, risky, long-term investments, not fewer?</p>\n\n<figure class=\"inline-large inline\">\n<img src=\"http://h.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/inline-large/inline/2014/04/3028156-inline-i-3-185-the-google-x-way.jpg\" alt=\"\"><figcaption><em>Rich DeVaul</em> heads the Rapid Evaluation team. \"If there's a completely crazy, lame idea, then it's probably coming from me.\"</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>Generally speaking, there are three criteria that X projects share. All must address a problem that affects millions--or better yet, billions--of people. All must utilize a radical solution that has at least a component that resembles science fiction. And all must tap technologies that are now (or very nearly) obtainable. But to DeVaul, the head of Rapid Eval, there's another, more unifying principle that connects the three criteria: No idea should be incremental. This sounds terribly clich&#xE9;d, DeVaul admits; the Silicon Valley refrain of \"taking huge risks\" is getting hackneyed and hollow. But the rejection of incrementalism, he says, is not because he and his colleagues believe it's pointless for ideological reasons. They believe it for practical reasons. \"It's so hard to do almost anything in this world,\" he says. \"Getting out of bed in the morning can be hard for me. But attacking a problem that is twice as big or 10 times as big is not twice or 10 times as hard.\"</p>\n\n<p>DeVaul insists that it's often just as easy, or easier, to make inroads on the biggest problems \"than to try to optimize the next 5% or 2% out of some process.\" Think about cars, he tells me. If you want to design a car that gets 80 mpg, it requires a lot of work, yet it really doesn't address the fundamental problem of global fuel resources and emissions. But if you want to design a car that gets 500 mpg, which actually does attack the problem, you are by necessity freed from convention, since you can't possibly improve an existing automotive design by such a degree. Instead you start over, reexamining what a car really is. You think of different kinds of motors and fuels, or of space-age materials of such gossamer weight and iron durability that they alter the physics of transportation. Or you dump the idea of cars altogether in favor of a &#xAD;substitute. And then maybe, just maybe, you come up with something worthy of X.</p>\n\n<p>DeVaul is leaning back on a chair in a big ground-floor conference room at X. He's brought me here to demonstrate how the Rapid Eval team discusses ideas. We're joined around an oblong wood table by two of his colleagues, Dan Piponi and Mitch Heinrich. The men are a study in intellectual contrasts. Piponi, 47, is soft-spoken, laconic, British--a mathematician and theoretical physicist and the winner of those Oscars. Even among the bright minds at Google X, he's regarded as freakishly smart. Heinrich, the lab's young design guru, gives off an affable art-school vibe. On his own initiative, he's built what's known as the design kitchen, a large fabrication shop that's stocked with 3-D printers, table saws, and sophisticated lathes in a building adjacent to the primary X lab. He brings a plastic tub stuffed with old eyeglass frames to the Rapid Eval session. \"These were some early prototypes for Glass,\" he explains, randomly pulling out some circuit boards and a few terrifically ugly designs. They weren't intended for the market, he says, but to show his colleagues that what they were conceptualizing could indeed be built.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"inline-large inline\">\n<img src=\"http://h.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/inline-large/inline/2014/04/3028156-inline-s-10-185-the-google-x-way.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n</figure>\n\n<p>DeVaul, 43, completes the trio. He has a PhD from MIT and worked at Apple for several years before coming to Google. It is difficult to figure out precisely what he studied in college--after 10 minutes of explaining, it sounds like some mashup of design, physics, anthropology, and &#xAD;machine learning. As such, he can talk a blue streak on a dazzling range of topics: crime, communications, computers, material science, robotics. It was DeVaul, in fact, who came up with the idea for Project Loon, as those &#xAD;Wi-Fi balloons are officially known. He tried desperately to make it fail on technological grounds but found he could not, so he agreed to run the project for about a year before returning to Rapid Eval.</p>\n\n<p>In some respects, watching his group in action is like watching an improv team warm up--ideas are bounced about quickly, analytically, &#xAD;kinetically, in an effort to make them stick or lead toward something better. The team on most Rapid Eval sessions numbers about half a dozen, including DeVaul, Piponi, and Heinrich (and sometimes Teller); they meet for lunch once a week to &#xAD;discuss suggestions that have bubbled up from within X or have filtered in from outside--from their parent company, say, or somebody's &#xAD;acquaintance in academia. Later in the week, one or two of the best suggestions are brought up again more formally for further consideration. Mostly the team looks at the scale of the issue, the impact of the proposed fix, and the technological risks. Will it really solve the problem? Can the thing actually be built? Then they &#xAD;consider the social risks. If we can build it, will it--can it--actually be used?</p>\n\n<p><aside class=\"pullquote highlight\"><q>This is the point in the conversation when we start talking, quite seriously, about hoverboards and space elevators.</q></aside></p>\n\n<p>There's a reason they factor these questions into their early calculus. When you're explicitly trying to imagine products that have no real counterparts in our culture, the obstacles have to be imagined, too. With driverless cars, for instance, there remain unresolved complexities of state laws, infrastructure, and insurance; for Google Glass, there are huge ongoing privacy issues. But if the team believes these kinds of hurdles are surmountable and is still sufficiently curious about a technology by the end of the discussion, they'll ask Heinrich or Piponi to build a crude prototype, ideally in a few days. Once they're satisfied that it can work, they move toward getting the brass to officially commission the project. They will not say how often this has happened, except that it's exceedingly rare. \"It's a really high bar to say, 'This is going to be a new Google X project,'&#x2009;\" says DeVaul. And that doesn't mean it won't be killed as it evolves. It's a much higher bar to actually launch a Google X project, he points out. \"Sometimes the problems at Google X are very easy to frame, such as two-thirds of the world does not have reliable, affordable Internet access.\" That's what led him to Project Loon. \"But some problems are easier to see in the rearview mirror. Imagine how hard it would be to explain to your pre-smartphone self how much this is going to change your life.\" DeVaul says this is the type of thinking that led to Google Glass. \"It's a matter of looking back from the future, where &#xAD;everyone walks around with smart glasses and no one leaves their house without them. And then it becomes obvious: 'Well, of course I want to be connected to information, but in a way that's minimally invasive, and minimally imposes on my attention.'\"</p>\n\n<p>He makes it sound quite reasonable. But this is also the point in the conversation when we start talking, quite seriously, about hoverboards and space elevators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>DeVaul is an avid skateboarder,</strong> and building a hoverboard is something that he has long imagined. \"I just wanted one,\" he tells me, shrugging. When he brought it up for discussion last year--\"If there's a completely crazy, lame idea, then it's probably coming from me,\" he says--the group actually discerned some practical applications. In industrial settings, moving heavy things on a frictionless platform could be not only valuable but transformative. \"Imagine a giant fulfillment center like Amazon's, where all the pallets can levitate and move around,\" DeVaul says. \"Or what about a lab where all the heavy equipment would come to me?\"</p>\n\n<figure class=\"inline-large inline\">\n<img src=\"http://g.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/inline-large/inline/2014/04/3028156-inline-s-4-185-the-google-x-way.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n</figure>\n\n<p>\"Dan, show him the hoverboard you built,\" says Heinrich.</p>\n\n<p>\"Right,\" says Piponi, sitting up and clearing his throat. In front of him is a small, shiny rectangle, about the size of a hardcover book. On the surface is a tight configuration of circular magnets. \"So the first question here relates to the physics,\" Piponi says. \"Can you actually have an object hovering about? And so people try really hard with magnets--to find some arrangement that keeps something hovering.\" This is the logic behind the superfast magnetic-levitation trains now used in China and Japan. But these \"mag-lev\" systems have a stabilizing structure that keeps trains in place as they hover and move forward in only one direction. That couldn't quite translate into an open floor plan of magnets that keep a hoverboard steadily aloft and free to move in any direction. One problem, as Piponi explains, is that magnets tend to keep shifting polarities, so your hoverboard would constantly flip over as you floated around moving from a state of repulsion to attraction with the magnets. Any skateboarder could tell you what that means: Your hoverboard would suck.</p>\n\n<p>But that's exactly the sort of problem X is designed to attack. \"There are loopholes in this theorem that you have to find,\" Piponi says. \"There are materials that are kind of weird, that don't behave like magnets normally do.\" Piponi discovered that a very thin slice of a certain type of graphite would actually work well on a small bed of magnets. So he built one for the Rapid Eval team. He pushes his small hoverboard across the table to me, and I try it. The graphite slice, not much larger than a quarter, floats slightly above the magnets, gliding in any direction with the most ethereal push. When DeVaul first saw this, he tells me, he was astounded.</p>\n\n<p>Yet by that point, Piponi had already moved on. As he did the calculations involved in expanding the small hoverboard up to a usable size, the physics suggested that at a certain point the weight of the board would knock it off its cushion of air. Other technologies could conceivably help (you might try using special materials at supercool temperatures), but the team &#xAD;decided that would create huge additional costs and complications--costs that would not be justified by the project's relatively modest social and economic impact. So the Google X hoverboard was shelved. \"When we let it go, it's a positive thing,\" DeVaul says. \"We're saying, 'This is great: Now we get to work on other things.'\"</p>\n\n<p>Like space elevators, something X was widely rumored to be working on but has never confirmed until now. \"You know what a space &#xAD;elevator is, right?\" DeVaul asks. He ticks off the essential facts--a cable attached to a satellite fixed in space, tens of thousands of miles above Earth. To DeVaul, it would no doubt satisfy the X criteria of something straight out of sci-fi. And it would presumably be transformative by reducing space travel to a fraction of its present cost: Transport ships would clip on to the cable and cruise up to a space station. One could go up while another was heading down. \"It would be a massive capital investment,\" DeVaul says, but after that \"it could take you from ground to orbit with a net of basically zero energy. It drives down the space-access costs, operationally, to being incredibly low.\"</p>\n\n<p>Not surprisingly, the team encountered a stumbling block. If scaling problems are what brought hoverboards down to earth, material-science issues crashed the space elevator. The team knew the cable would have to be exceptionally strong-- \"at least a hundred times stronger than the strongest steel that we have,\" by &#xAD;Piponi's calculations. He found one material that could do this: carbon nanotubes. But no one has manufactured a perfectly formed carbon nanotube strand longer than a meter. And so elevators \"were put in a deep freeze,\" as Heinrich says, and the team decided to keep tabs on any advances in the carbon nanotube field.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"inline-large inline\">\n<img src=\"http://b.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/inline-large/inline/2014/04/3028156-inline-i-5-185-the-google-x-way.jpg\" alt=\"\"><figcaption><em>Mitch Heinrich</em> created Google X's design kitchen, where he and other team members build simple prototypes for big ideas.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p><aside class=\"pullquote highlight\"><q>There's a moment of silence in the room. \"I know that sounds completely insane,\" DeVaul says. But I'm not sure it sounds crazy to him.</q></aside></p>\n\n<p>The larger lesson here is that any Google X idea that hinges on some kind of new development in material science cannot proceed. This is not the case with electronics--X could go forward with a device that depends upon near-term improvements in computing capability because Moore's law predicts an exponential increase in computing power. That is why DeVaul's team is confident that Google Glass will get less awkward with each passing year. But there is no way to accurately predict when a new material or manufacturing process will be invented. It could happen next year, or it could be 100 years.</p>\n\n<p>The conversation eventually drifts to how the team had at one point debated the pros and cons of taking on teleportation. Yes, like in <em>Star&#xA0;Trek</em>. As with that show's Transporter, the molecules of a person or thing could theoretically be \"beamed\" across a physical distance with the help of some kind of scanning technology and a teleportation device. None of which really &#xAD;exists, of course. Piponi, after some study, concluded that teleportation violates several laws of physics. But out of those discussions came a number of insights--too complicated to explain here--into encrypted communications that would be resistant to eavesdropping, a matter of great interest to Google (especially in light of recent NSA&#x2013;spying revelations). So bad ideas lead to good ideas, too. \"I like to look at these problems as ladders,\" DeVaul says.</p>\n\n<p>At the moment, the Rapid Eval team is watching the work of certain academics who are &#xAD;attempting to create superstrong, ultralight materials.</p>\n\n<p>One Caltech professor, Julia Greer, is working on something called \"nanotrusses\" that DeVaul is particularly enthusiastic about. \"It would completely change how we build buildings,\" he says. \"Because if I have something that's insanely strong and incredibly compact, maybe I could prefabricate an entire building; it fits into a little box, I take it to the construction site, and it unfolds like origami and becomes a building that is stronger than anything we have right now and holds a volume as big as this building.\" There's a moment of silence in the room.</p>\n\n<p>\"I know that sounds completely insane,\" he adds. But I'm not sure it sounds crazy to him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>At one point, DeVaul asks</strong> if I have any ideas of my own for Rapid Eval consideration. I had been warned in advance that he might ask this, and I came prepared with a suggestion: a \"smart bullet\" that could protect potential shooting victims and reduce gun violence, both accidental and intentional. You have self-driving cars that avoid harm, I say. Why not self-driving ballistics? DeVaul doesn't say it's the stupidest thing he's ever heard, which is a relief. What ensues is a conversation that feels like a rapid ascent up that imaginary ladder. We quickly debate the pros and cons of making guns intelligent (that technology &#xAD;already exists to a certain degree) versus making bullets intelligent (likely much more difficult). We move from a specific discussion of \"self-&#xAD;pulverizing\" bullets with tiny, embedded hypodermic needles that deliver stun-drugs (DeVaul's idea) to potentially using sensors and the force of gravity to bring a bullet to the ground before it can strike the wrong target (Heinrich's). Then comes the notion of separating the bullet's striker from the explosive charge with a remote disabling electronic switch (Piponi). The tenor soon changes, though. We start talking about smart holsters for police officers, and then intelligent gun sights--&#xAD;something that firearms owners might actually want to buy. They think that idea might even be worth a rapid prototype. But we also debate the political and marketplace viability of bullet technology--who would purchase it, who would object to it, what kind of impact it might have. Eventually it becomes clear that in many ways, appearances often to the contrary, Google X tries hard to remain on the practical side of crazy.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"inline-large inline\">\n<img src=\"http://a.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/inline-large/inline/2014/04/3028156-inline-i-4-185-the-google-x-way.jpg\" alt=\"\"><figcaption><em>Obi Felton</em>'s official title is Head of Getting Moonshots Ready for Contact With the Real World.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<p>Later in the day, I take a walk around the Google campus with Obi Felton, 41, who is the team member who tries to keep the group grounded. In fact, DeVaul refers to her as \"the normal person\" in Rapid Eval meetings, someone who can bring everyone back to earth by asking simple questions like, Is it legal? Will anyone buy this? Will anyone like this? Felton is not an engineer; she worked in marketing for Google in Europe before coming to X. \"My actual title now,\" she tells me, \"is Head of Getting Moonshots Ready for Contact With the Real World.\" One thing Felton struggles with is that there's no real template for how a company should bring these kinds of radical technologies to market. (\"If you find a model,\" she says, \"let me know.\") Fortunately for X, not everything has to evolve into a huge source of revenue. \"The portfolio has to make money,\" Felton explains, but not necessarily each product. \"Some of these will be better businesses than others, if you want to measure in terms of dollars. Others might make a huge impact on the world, but it's not a massive market.\"</p>\n\n<p>Later this year, X hopes to announce a top-secret new project that is likely to fall into that latter category. What will it be? There are no discernible clues. In my own conversations, I could only glean certain hints--that they're extremely curious about transportation and clean energy, and that they are especially serious about creating better medical diagnostics, rather than medical treatments, because they see a far greater impact. At one point, I walked through a Google X user-experience lab, where psychologists gain insights from volunteers trying possible forthcoming technologies. A large object, about, oh, the size of the Maltese Falcon, had been wrapped in black plastic. Go figure.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, consider that X has an overwhelming task on its hands already. The organization must move all of its unveiled projects at least one square ahead this year. Project Loon--which has not finalized a business plan yet--has apparently drawn interest from most of the telecom companies in the world, but is still not technically ready for scaling up. (It was unveiled in part because the patents were about to be made public, and Google preferred to disclose it on its own terms.) Google Glass, the X product closest to commercialization, and self-driving cars, which are much farther away, have both sparked extraordinary public interest, yet it is impossible to say if or when they'll succeed as businesses, or whether they'll have that 10-times impact within a 10-year period.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"inline-large inline\">\n<img src=\"http://f.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/inline-large/inline/2014/04/3028156-inline-s-5-185-the-google-x-way.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n</figure>\n\n<p>That evening at dinner with Teller, I bring up all of these issues. To me, the fundamental challenge of fashioning extreme solutions to very big problems is that society tends to move incrementally, even as many fields of technology seem to advance exponentially. An innovation that saves us time or money or improves our health might always have a fighting chance at success. But with Glass, we see a product that seems to alter not only our safety and &#xAD;efficiency--like with self-driving cars--but our humanity. This seems an even bigger obstacle than some of the more practical issues that the lab grapples with, but the Xers don't seem overly concerned. Teller, in fact, contends that Glass could make us more human. He thinks it solves a huge &#xAD;problem--getting those square rectangles out of our pockets and making technology more usable, more available, less obstructive. But isn't it possible that Glass is the wrong answer to the right problem? \"Of course,\" Teller says. \"But we're not done. And it's possible that we missed. I mean, I know we missed in some ways.\"</p>\n\n<p>The part of the X process that colleagues like Obi Felton think about, he says, is also meant to be iterative. \"It's to say to the world: What do you think? How can we make this better? It's part of us being open to being wrong, because it's way easier, and way cheaper, and way more fun to find out now that we missed than to find out years from now, with an incredible amount of additional expense and emotional investment.\" Teller says he calls X's ideas \"moonshots\" for a reason. \"If one of Google X's projects were a home run, became &#xAD;everything we wanted, I would be really happy,\" he says. \"I would be overjoyed if it happened with two.\"</p>\n\n<p>At one point, I mention my own moonshot to Teller, that smart bullet that DeVaul's team had talked through earlier in the day. It wasn't a disaster, I say, but it wasn't much of a success, either. \"Well, that's entirely appropriate,\" Teller says, sympathetically. \"Most ideas don't work out. Almost all ideas don't work out. So it's okay if yours didn't work out.\" He thinks for a moment. \"How about instead of a bullet it delivers a deadly toxin that could be reversed in a week?\" It wouldn't stop bad guys immediately, he says, but once they were shot, they would have to go turn themselves in to get the antidote. He mulls it over for a moment more. \"I don't know,\" he says, already seeing the obstacles ahead. \"I'm just brainstorming.\"</p>\n    </div>\n\n    \n      \n        </div>","related":{}},"5":{"title":"AngelListâ€™s Newest Experiment: a $25 Million Fund to Invest in Angel Investors","content":"<div><div class=\"post-content\">\n                <div class=\"mceTemp imageFormat-E\">\n<dl class=\"wp-caption alignright caption-alignright \">\n<dt class=\"wp-caption-dt\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-5\" src=\"http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-CJ356_angell_E_20140414225414.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"359\"></dt>\n<dd class=\"wp-caption-dd\">AngelList, an online forum connecting individual investors with startups, is trying a new fund called Maiden Lane that will invest in angels and co-invest in select startups.</dd>\n</dl>\n</div>\n<p>A new experiment in startup funding could have widespread ramifications for the way venture capitalists place bets on young companies.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, crowdsourced fundraising site AngelList unveiled a new fund that has raised about $25 million from limited partners who traditionally invest in venture-capital funds.&#xA0;The fund, called <a href=\"http://maidenlane.herokuapp.com/?display=yes\">Maiden Lane</a>, will bet about $200,000 each on the site&#x2019;s top investors and on select startups picked by them.</p>\n<p>The arrangement gives prominent individual investors&#x2013;so-called angels&#x2013;more leverage to write bigger checks for promising startups, while also ensuring limited partners get more direct access to startups with fewer fees.</p>\n<p>Over the years, some of the institutional investors who place money in venture-capital funds have complained about the industry&#x2019;s minimal transparency, high fees and poor performance metrics.</p>\n<p>Yet while some venture firms have adopted more palatable fee models and shared more information, the industry&#x2019;s dynamics have largely remained unchanged. Venture firms typically charge a 2% management fee and take 20% to 30% of the profit, or what&#x2019;s known as a carry. This structure incentivizes venture capitalists to raise larger funds and allows them to make money even when they fail to return capital, some limited partners say.</p>\n<p>AngelList, an online forum connecting angels with startups, is aiming to shake up the industry.</p>\n<p>Maiden Lane will operate as a kind-of fund of funds with relatively cheap economics. It will charge zero management fees and a 30% carry. But only one-third of the carry will go to the fund&#x2019;s general partners&#x2013;which include AngelList operating chief Kevin Laws and Dustin Dolginow, a venture partner at Atlas Venture. The rest goes toward paying the angels&#x2019; own carry which are roughly 20% on average.</p>\n<p>Its limited partners include Cendana Capital, Makena Capital Management and Venture Investments Associates, which typically shuttle their money to early stage venture firms either directly or through funds of funds. Maiden Lane has already picked several angels, including Joshua Schachter, co-founder of Delicious, the online bookmarks manager that was acquired by Yahoo Inc., and Elad Gil, a former Twitter Inc. executive.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;What we&#x2019;re basically now enabling is directly connecting Wall Street to Silicon Valley,&#x201D; said Naval Ravikant, the chief executive and co-founder of AngelList.</p>\n<div class=\"mceTemp imageFormat-E\">\n<dl class=\"wp-caption alignright caption-alignright \">\n<dt class=\"wp-caption-dt\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-5\" src=\"http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-CJ351_ravika_E_20140414223753.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"359\"></dt>\n<dd class=\"wp-caption-dd\">Naval Ravikant, co-founder and CEO of AngelList</dd>\n\n</dl>\n</div>\n<p>Mr. Ravikant envisions eventually creating a software platform that can support hundreds of millions of dollars and let institutional investors build customized startup portfolios. So a firm could theoretically decide to invest $40 million in angel investors who operate in New York, largely back mobile startups and have returned a certain return on investment.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Some day you&#x2019;re going to sit at your Schwab account or your Fidelity account and you&#x2019;re going to say, &#x2018;I&#x2019;d like to take 1% of my net worth and put it into angel deals,&#x2019;&#x201D; he said.</p>\n<p>For now, the fund is small and may take several years to judge its full effect and prove to institutional investors it is worth the commitment.</p>\n<p>But it is an experiment that will be watched closely by venture capitalists.</p>\n<p>While some applaud the move because it increases startups&#x2019; access to funds &#x2014; especially for those that might be overlooked by venture firms &#x2014; it could also threaten the current establishment, increasing competition for smaller venture firms and forcing others to lower their fees and prove their worth. If the model scales, bigger funds than Maiden Lane will be created, potentially disrupting more players up the chain.</p>\n<p>Mr. Ravikant acknowledges that venture capitalists &#x201C;are not predisposed to like this, as some could see it as competitive.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Mr. Ravikant, an entrepreneur and angel investor whose early bets include Twitter Inc. and Foursquare Inc., has sought to create more transparency and efficiency to startup investing ever since he founded AngelList in 2010. His mission stems in part from a spat earlier in his career in which he and other founders of Epinions.com sued two venture firms, claiming they were misled about the value of the company and cheated out of tens of millions of dollars. The suit was settled for an undisclosed sum in 2005.</p>\n<p>According to Mr. Ravikant, Maiden Lane is a natural progression for AngelList, which began as a kind of matchmaking forum for startups and investors.&#xA0;Since then, AngelList has become a popular service for startups to organize fundraising rounds. More than 100,000 startups and more than 25,000 accredited investors have listed on the site.</p>\n<p>In September, AngelList began to allow carefully vetted angels to form syndicates, essentially followers who agree to co-invest alongside that well-connected investor&#x2019;s picks. The move, which significantly multiplied the amount of money such angels could deploy, took advantage of the recent easing on some of the government&#x2019;s long-standing restrictions on fundraising.&#xA0;So far about $30 million has been invested by these syndicates.</p>\n<p>Mr. Ravikant says Maiden Lane is addressing a need born out of a confluence of factors. First, there is an explosion of startups, driven by the rising popularity of technology and the falling costs to start a digital business.</p>\n<p>AngelList is now adding about 200 new startups per day. The excess of white noise is pushing some of the biggest venture firms outside of the early stage bracket. Though many firms continue to make exceptions, several have begun to pull back on seed stage deals.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, limited partners are hungry to get some exposure to early stage startups but are eager to avoid the layers of fees that that often entails.</p>\n<p>There is concern about whether AngelList, as the platform, should be picking winners and whether its cherry-picking will create bad signals for those who aren&#x2019;t chosen. Pressure could be greatest on smaller venture firms who aren&#x2019;t in the AngelList club, now with competitors who operate at a cheaper cost.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The concern, is at the micro-VC level,&#x201D; said Semil Shah, manager of the Haystack Fund, a small early stage fund, and a self-professed AngelList supporter. &#x201C;This kind of fund goes direct to the entrepreneur, so it could be quicker on deals, edging out others.&#x201D;</p>\n      \n          </div>      \n      \n      \n            \n\n    </div>","related":{}},"6":{"title":"Cracking Cloudflare's heartbleed challenge","content":"<div><section class=\"post-content\"><a href=\"https://blog.indutny.com/\" class=\"home-link\">&lt;&lt; Home</a><h2 id=\"challenge\">Challenge</h2>\n<p>At April 11th 2014 Cloudflare has published a <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/answering-the-critical-question-can-you-get-private-ssl-keys-using-heartbleed\">blog post</a> suggesting to\ntry out extracting a private key of their specially prepared\n<a href=\"https://www.cloudflarechallenge.com/heartbleed\">challenge site</a> using the <a href=\"http://heartbleed.com/\">Heartbleed</a> OpenSSL vulnerability.

When the researchers Joan E. Grusec and Erica Redler praised the character of 5-year-olds, any benefits that may have emerged didn&#x2019;t have a lasting impact: They may have been too young to internalize moral character as part of a stable sense of self. And by the time children turned 10, the differences between praising character and praising actions vanished: Both were effective. Tying generosity to character appears to matter most around age 8, when children may be starting to crystallize notions of identity.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Praise in response to good behavior may be half the battle, but our responses to bad behavior have consequences, too. When children cause harm, they typically feel one of two moral emotions: shame or guilt. Despite the common belief that these emotions are interchangeable, <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1996-11309-001\">research led by the psychologist June Price Tangney</a> reveals that they have very different causes and consequences.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Shame is the feeling that I am a bad person, whereas guilt is the feeling that I have done a bad thing. Shame is a negative judgment about the core self, which is devastating: Shame makes children feel small and worthless, and they respond either by lashing out at the target or escaping the situation altogether. In contrast, guilt is a negative judgment about an action, which can be repaired by good behavior. When children feel guilt, they tend to experience remorse and regret, empathize with the person they have harmed, and aim to make it right.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">In <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02699939308409201\">one study spearheaded by the psychologist Karen Caplovitz Barrett</a>, parents rated their toddlers&#x2019; tendencies to experience shame and guilt at home. The toddlers received a rag doll, and the leg fell off while they were playing with it alone. The shame-prone toddlers avoided the researcher and did not volunteer that they broke the doll. The guilt-prone toddlers were more likely to fix the doll, approach the experimenter, and explain what happened. The ashamed toddlers were avoiders; the guilty toddlers were amenders.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-2\">If we want our children to care about others, we need to teach them to feel guilt rather than shame when they misbehave. In a <a href=\"http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.psych.51.1.665\">review of research on emotions and moral development</a>, the psychologist Nancy Eisenberg suggests that shame emerges when parents express anger, withdraw their love, or try to assert their power through threats of punishment: Children may begin to believe that they are bad people. Fearing this effect, some parents <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0305724980270307\">fail to exercise discipline</a> at all, <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/23087249?uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21103972981353\">which can hinder the development</a> of strong moral standards.</p><div id=\"Moses\" class=\"ad moses-ad\"><a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/12/opinion/sunday/raising-a-moral-child.html?emc=eta1#story-continues-2\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">The most effective response to bad behavior is to express disappointment. According to independent reviews by Professor <a href=\"http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.psych.51.1.665\">Eisenberg</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Social-Personality-Development-David-Shaffer/dp/0495600385\">David R. Shaffer</a>, parents raise caring children by expressing disappointment and explaining why the behavior was wrong, how it affected others, and how they can rectify the situation. This enables children to develop standards for judging their actions, feelings of empathy and responsibility for others, and a <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21800215\">sense of moral identity</a>, which are conducive to <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1131778?uid=3739864&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21103253577943\">becoming a helpful person</a>. The beauty of expressing disappointment is that it communicates disapproval of the bad behavior, coupled with high expectations and the potential for improvement: &#x201C;You&#x2019;re a good person, even if you did a bad thing, and I know you can do better.&#x201D;</p><div class=\"ad ad-placeholder\"><a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/12/opinion/sunday/raising-a-moral-child.html?emc=eta1#story-continues-4\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n</div><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-4\">As powerful as it is to criticize bad behavior and praise good character, raising a generous child involves more than waiting for opportunities to react to the actions of our children. As parents, we want to be proactive in communicating our values to our children. Yet many of us do this the wrong way.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">In a <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/31/3/459/\">classic experiment</a>, the psychologist J. Philippe Rushton gave 140 elementary- and middle-school-age children tokens for winning a game, which they could keep entirely or donate some to a child in poverty. They first watched a teacher figure play the game either selfishly or generously, and then preach to them the value of taking, giving or neither. The adult&#x2019;s influence was significant: Actions spoke louder than words. When the adult behaved selfishly, children followed suit. The words didn&#x2019;t make much difference &#x2014; children gave fewer tokens after observing the adult&#x2019;s selfish actions, regardless of whether the adult verbally advocated selfishness or generosity. When the adult acted generously, students gave the same amount whether generosity was preached or not &#x2014; they donated 85 percent more than the norm in both cases. When the adult preached selfishness, even after the adult acted generously, the students still gave 49 percent more than the norm. Children learn generosity not by listening to what their role models say, but by observing what they do.</p><figure class=\"media photo embedded has-adjacency layout-large-horizontal\">\n    \n    <div class=\"image\">\n            <img src=\"http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/13/sunday-review/0413moral/0413moral-articleLarge.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"media-viewer-candidate\">\n            <meta value=\"http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/13/sunday-review/0413moral/0413moral-articleLarge.jpg\">\n            <meta value=\"477\">\n            <meta value=\"600\">\n    </div>\n        <figcaption class=\"caption\">\n        \n                \n            </figcaption>\n    </figure>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">To test whether these role-modeling effects persisted over time, two months later researchers observed the children playing the game again. Would the modeling or the preaching influence whether the children gave &#x2014; and would they even remember it from two months earlier?</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">The most generous children were those who watched the teacher give but not say anything. Two months later, these children were 31 percent more generous than those who observed the same behavior but also heard it preached. The message from this research is loud and clear: If you don&#x2019;t model generosity, preaching it may not help in the short run, and in the long run, preaching is less effective than giving while saying nothing at all.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">People often believe that character causes action, but when it comes to producing moral children, we need to remember that action also shapes character.

Pathfinding is complex. Why bother with pathfinding? Consider the following situation:</p><div class=\"figure\"><img width=\"450\" src=\"http://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/GameProgramming/concave1.png\" alt=\"\"></div><p>The unit is initially at the bottom of the map and wants to get to the top. There is nothing in the area it scans (shown in pink) to indicate that the unit should not move up, so it continues on its way. Near the top, it detects an obstacle and changes direction. It then finds its way around the &#x201C;U&#x201D;-shaped obstacle, following the red path. In contrast, a pathfinder would have scanned a larger area (shown in light blue), but found a shorter path (blue), never sending the unit into the concave shaped obstacle.</p><p>You can however extend a movement algorithm to work around traps like the one shown above. Either avoid creating concave obstacles, or mark their convex hulls as dangerous (to be entered only if the goal is inside):</p><div class=\"figure\"><img width=\"450\" src=\"http://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/GameProgramming/concave2.png\" alt=\"\"></div><p>Pathfinders let you look ahead and make plans rather than waiting until the last moment to discover there&#x2019;s a problem. There&#x2019;s a tradeoff between planning with pathfinders and reacting with movement algorithms. Planning generally is slower but gives better results; movement is generally faster but can get stuck. If the game world is changing often, planning ahead is less valuable. I recommend using both: pathfinding for big picture, slow changing obstacles and long paths; and movement for local area, fast changing, and short paths.</p></div><p class=\"h2banner\"><h2 id=\"algorithms\">Algorithms</h2></p><div class=\"topic\"><p> The pathfinding algorithms from computer science textbooks work on <em>graphs</em> in the mathematical sense&#x2015;a set of vertices with edges connecting them. A tiled game map can be considered a graph with each tile being a vertex and edges drawn between tiles that are adjacent to each other:</p><div class=\"figure\"><img width=\"246\" src=\"http://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/game-programming/a-star/map-as-graph.png\" alt=\"\"></div><p>For now, I will assume that we&#x2019;re using <a href=\"http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~amitp/game-programming/grids/\">two-dimensional grids</a>. If you haven&#x2019;t worked with graphs before, <a href=\"http://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/grids/graphs.html\">see this primer</a>. Later on, I&#x2019;ll discuss <a href=\"http://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/GameProgramming/MapRepresentations.html#polygonal-maps\">how to build other kinds of graphs out of your game world</a>.</p><p>Most pathfinding algorithms from AI or Algorithms research are designed for arbitrary graphs rather than grid-based games. We&#x2019;d like to find something that can take advantage of the grid nature of the map. There are some things we consider common sense, but that algorithms don&#x2019;t understand. For example, we know something about directions: we know that in general, as two things get farther apart, it will take a longer to move from one to the other; and we know that there aren&#x2019;t any secret wormholes that let you teleport from one spot on the map to another. (Well, I assume there aren&#x2019;t any; if there are, it becomes very hard to find a good path because you don&#x2019;t know where to look first.)</p></div><p class=\"h2banner\"><h2 id=\"dijkstras-algorithm-and-best-first-search\">Dijkstra&#x2019;s Algorithm and Best-First-Search</h2></p><div class=\"topic\"><p> Dijkstra&#x2019;s algorithm works by visiting vertices in the graph starting with the object&#x2019;s starting point. It then repeatedly examines the closest not-yet-examined vertex, adding its vertices to the set of vertices to be examined. it expands outwards from the starting point until it reaches the goal. Dijkstra&#x2019;s algorithm is guaranteed to find a shortest path from the starting point to the goal, as long as none of the edges have a negative cost. (I write &#x201C;a shortest path&#x201D; because there are often multiple equivalently-short paths.) In the following diagram, the pink square is the starting point, the blue square is the goal, and the teal areas show what areas Dijkstra&#x2019;s algorithm scanned. The lightest teal areas are those farthest from the starting point, and thus form the &#x201C;frontier&#x201D; of exploration:</p><div class=\"figure\"><img width=\"526\" src=\"http://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/game-programming/a-star/dijkstra.png\" alt=\"\"></div><p>The Greedy Best-First-Search algorithm works in a similar way, except that it has some estimate (called a <em>heuristic</em>) of how far from the goal any vertex is. Instead of selecting the vertex closest to the starting point, it selects the vertex closest to the goal. (Greedy) Best-First-Search is <em>not</em> guaranteed to find a shortest path. However, it runs much quicker than Dijkstra&#x2019;s algorithm because it uses the heuristic function to guide its way towards the goal very quickly. For example, if the goal is to the south of the starting position, Best-First-Search will tend to focus on paths that lead southwards. In the following diagram, yellow represents those nodes with a high heuristic value (high cost to get to the goal) and black represents nodes with a low heuristic value (low cost to get to the goal). It shows that Best-First-Search can find paths very quickly compared to Dijkstra&#x2019;s algoritm:</p><div class=\"figure\"><img width=\"526\" src=\"http://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/game-programming/a-star/best-first-search.png\" alt=\"\"></div><p>However, both of these examples illustrate the simplest case&#x2015;when the map has no obstacles, and the shortest path really is a straight line. Let&#x2019;s consider the concave obstacle as described in the previous section. Dijkstra&#x2019;s algorithm works harder but is guaranteed to find a shortest path:</p><div class=\"figure\"><img width=\"526\" src=\"http://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/game-programming/a-star/dijkstra-trap.png\" alt=\"\"></div><p>Best-First-Search on the other hand does less work but its path is clearly not as good:</p><div class=\"figure\"><img width=\"526\" src=\"http://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/game-programming/a-star/best-first-search-trap.png\" alt=\"\"></div><p>The trouble is that Greedy Best-First-Search is &#x201C;greedy&#x201D; and tries to move towards the goal even if it&#x2019;s not the right path. Since it only considers the cost to get to the goal and ignores the cost of the path so far, it keeps going even if the path it&#x2019;s on has become really long.</p><p>Wouldn&#x2019;t it be nice to combine the best of both? A* was developed in 1968 to combine heuristic approaches like Best-First-Search and formal approaches like Dijsktra&#x2019;s algorithm. It&#x2019;s a little unusual in that heuristic approaches usually give you an approximate way to solve problems without guaranteeing that you get the best answer. However, A* is built on top of the heuristic, and although the heuristic itself does not give you a guarantee, A* <em>can</em> guarantee a shortest path.</p></div><p class=\"h2banner\"><h2 id=\"the-a-star-algorithm\">The A* Algorithm</h2></p><div class=\"topic\"><p> I will be focusing on the <strong><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-star_search_algorithm\">A* Algorithm</a></strong>. A* is the most popular choice for pathfinding, because it&#x2019;s fairly flexible and can be used in a wide range of contexts.</p><p>A* is like other graph-searching algorithms in that it can potentially search a huge area of the map. It&#x2019;s like Dijkstra&#x2019;s algorithm in that it can be used to find a shortest path. It&#x2019;s like Greedy Best-First-Search in that it can use a heuristic to guide itself. In the simple case, it is as fast as Best-First-Search:</p><div class=\"figure\"><img width=\"526\" src=\"http://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/game-programming/a-star/a-star.png\" alt=\"\"></div><p>In the example with a concave obstacle, A* finds a path as good as what Dijkstra&#x2019;s algorithm found:</p><div class=\"figure\"><img width=\"526\" src=\"http://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/game-programming/a-star/a-star-trap.png\" alt=\"\"></div><p>The secret to its success is that it combines the pieces of information that Dijkstra&#x2019;s algorithm uses (favoring vertices that are close to the starting point) <em>and</em> information that Best-First-Search uses (favoring vertices that are close to the goal). In the standard terminology used when talking about A*, <code>g(n)</code> represents the <em>exact cost</em> of the path from the starting point to any vertex <code>n</code>, and <code>h(n)</code> represents the heuristic <em>estimated cost</em> from vertex <code>n</code> to the goal. In the above diagrams, the yellow (<code>h</code>) represents vertices far from the goal and teal (<code>g</code>) represents vertices far from the starting point. A* balances the two as it moves from the starting point to the goal. Each time through the main loop, it examines the vertex <code>n</code> that has the lowest <code>f(n) = g(n) + h(n)</code>.</p></div></div></div>","related":{}},"11":{"title":"Deploy and Manage Your\nDocker\nContainers.","content":"<div><div class=\"col-md-9 col-lg-10\" id=\"content\">\n\n<div class=\"jumbotron\">\n\n<p class=\"lead\">\nProject Atomic integrates the tools and patterns of container-based application\nand service deployment with trusted operating system platforms to deliver an\nend-to-end hosting architecture that's modern, reliable and secure.\n</p>\n<p>\nCloud images are available for download, supporting VirtualBox, QEMU/KVM and OpenStack.

All I wanted to do was sell it online to my followers. I figured it would be pretty simple to find a service for this, but it wasn't. So I built a quick prototype of what was basically bit.ly for payments with Python on App Engine and threw it on HN. The response was amazing. I'm not one to rush into stuff, but when I thought about how fundamentally empowering this was, I knew I had to do it.\n            \n              <p class=\"question\">You're building for creatives and other nontechnical people. What kind of design challenges does that introduce?</p>\n              Most of our customers are highly nontechnical, and don't even think of themselves as businesses. So every aspect of the product is optimized for simplicity. Our goal is to make selling to your audience as easy as Instagramming a photo. And what makes the problem even more interesting is that it's not just one kind of media. We're in so many verticals. Our recommendation engine, our workflows, have to be equally good for music, videos, games - There is no 'One Perfect Recommendation Algorithm'.\n            \n              <p class=\"question\">You're a designer by trade and an artist at heart. Any final comments on your design philosophy at Gumroad?</p>\n              Hm, just this- words like 'beautiful', 'simple', 'elegant' - you can apply these to anything we build here. But at the end of the day, they're just means to an end. The creators need to get money in the bank. Otherwise, the product isn't working. That is the real core of our design philosophy.\n            \n          </div>\n          \n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    \n    <div class=\"content\">\n      <div class=\"container\">\n        \n        <div class=\"row\">\n          \n          <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n            <h3>Tuhin</h3>\n            \n              <p class=\"question\">What's your setup?</p>\n              We have a simple service-oriented architecture on EC2. Aside from the main Rails app, there's a really simple Python Flask service behind Gunicorn that I work on. We use SciPy and NumPy for the ML stuff, New Relic and the Ruby daemon God to maintain stability and our SLA. We use SQS for what basically amounts to asynchronous RPC, and HTTP for synchronous RPC.\n            \n              <p class=\"question\">I thought many interesting fraud and machine learning algorithms were bottlenecked on CPU. Why Python instead of a lower-level language like Java or Go?</p>\n              In theory, yes. In practice, we're not really a Big Data shop yet. More of like, a Medium Data shop. <em>[we giggle]</em> Python, SciPy, and NumPy give us simplicity and iteration speed, which are key. Every transaction has a 300ms decision window for fraud on the first tier. We fast-succeed, so if we can't get a response back in the window, we let the second tier catch it after the fact.\n            \n              <p class=\"question\">That's really cool! Sounds like you have a multi-tier system, with different goals for each tier? I don't know a lot about ML by the way - can you go into a bit more detail?</p>\n              Yep, and sure. ML algorithms generally trade off between accuracy and speed. For our analyses, we've found that logistic regression is on the fast-but-less-effective end of the spectrum. A random forest is on the other end.  The first tier's optimized for speed, so the easy and simple stuff is there. After that, the request is dumped into an SQS queue where the second tier can act more accurately.\n            \n              <p class=\"question\">Makes sense. One of the last things I did at Amazon was a quick JS widget that stopped users from entering credit card numbers into the address field. It was surprisingly useful.</p>\n              Yep, we've found that detecting keyboard mashing is a surprisingly useful anti-fraud tactic. We model the keyboard in a two-dimensional space, and calculate the Euclidean distance between each key. If the keys aren't sufficiently distributed, we know that they're probably mashing. There's another pretty cool thing we do, which is deliberately build models on subsets of the features, and rank these submodels. So usually we can fast-fail even more quickly, because we don't need a big expensive model or all the features.\n            \n          </div>\n          \n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    \n    <div class=\"content\">\n      <div class=\"container\">\n        \n        <div class=\"row\">\n          \n          <div class=\"col-md-6\">\n            <h3>Amir</h3>\n            \n              <p class=\"question\">What do you currently work with?</p>\n              A bit of everything! I really like fast iteration. We have one giant Rails app for most of the site - you worked at Twitter, so you know what that's like -  and I spend a lot of time there. We use Flight for the front-end JS - it gives us decoupling and lets us test and ship quickly. For testing - Jasmine for unit, Capybara and Selenium for integration. We were on Jenkins but it got too slow and complicated too quickly. We're on CircleCI now, which is well worth the 50 bucks or whatever.\n            \n              <p class=\"question\">You're talking about a lot of tests, but you also really like fast iteration. Don't the tests impact your speed of iteration?</p>\n              Yes and no. We're managing money and credit cards, so we need rigor. While that impacts our short-term speed of iteration, we've seen it actually help our longer-term iteration speed. We're also introducing decoupling at just the right time - the fraud service Tuhin and the others work on is a good example of the right time to do it. An interesting side effect of all our choices so far is that Gumroad's code base has always been decent - no hair-on-fire moments like some other startups. I'm actually pretty proud of that.\n            \n              <p class=\"question\">Any other thoughts?</p>\n              Before I forget - one of the huge motivators for us is seeing people actually making a living on Gumroad. The story that has stuck with me was when a comic book author asked us to pay him a bit earlier - turned out he'd made $4,000 selling his comics online and needed it right away to get by. He literally depends on my code for rent and food. There are many stories like this. It's a good feeling. \n            \n              <p class=\"question\">Thanks Amir!</p>\n              Of course! \n            \n          </div>\n          \n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    \n    \n\n    <div class=\"content\">\n      <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row\">\n          \n          <p class=\"col-md-6\">\n            <em>Vaibhav Mallya on April 10, 2014.

The DevOps movement is so popular that I may as well say\nI hate the x86 architecture or monolithic kernels. But it's true: I can't stand\nit. The underlying cause of my pain? This fact: <em>not every company is a start-up, though it appears that every company must act as though they were.</em>\n</p>\n<h2>DevOps</h2>\n<p>\"DevOps\" is meant to denote a close collaboration and cross-pollination between what were previously purely\ndevelopment roles, purely operations roles, and purely QA roles. Because\nsoftware needs to be released at an ever-increasing rate, the old\n\"waterfall\" develop-test-release cycle is seen as broken. Developers must also\ntake responsibility for the quality of the testing and release environments.</p>\n<p>The increasing scope of responsibility of the \"developer\" (whether or not that term is even\nappropriate anymore is debatable) has given rise to a chimera-like job\ncandidate: the \"full-stack\" developer. Such a developer is capable of doing the\njob of developer, QA team member, operations analyst, sysadmin, and DBA. Before you\naccuse me of hyperbole, go back and read that list again. Is there any role in\nthe list whose duties you <em>wouldn't</em> expect a \"full-stack\" developer to be well versed in?</p>\n<p>Where did these concepts come from? Start-ups, of course (and the Agile\nmethodology). Start-ups are a peculiar beast and need to function in a very lean\nway to survive their first few years. <strong>I don't deny this</strong>. Unfortunately, we've taken the multiple\ntechnical roles that engineers at start-ups <em>were forced to play due to lack of resources</em>\ninto a set of minimum qualifications for the role of \"developer\".</p>\n<h2>Many Hats</h2>\n<p>Imagine you're at a start-up with a development team of seven. You're one year\ninto development of a web applications that X's all the Y's and things are going\nwell, though it's always a frantic scramble to keep everything going. If there's\na particularly nasty issue that seems to require deep database knowledge, you\ndon't have the liberty of saying \"that's not my specialty,\" and handing it off\nto a DBA team to investigate. <strong>Due to constrained resources,</strong> you're forced to\ntake on the role of DBA and fix the issue yourself.</p>\n<p>Now expand that scenario across all the roles listed earlier. At any\none time, a developer at a start-up may be acting as a developer, QA tester,\ndeployment/operations analyst, sysadmin, or DBA. That's just the nature of the\nbusiness, and some people thrive in that type of environment. Somewhere along\nthe way, however, we tricked ourselves into thinking that because, at any one\ntime, a start-up developer <em>had</em> to take on different roles he or she <em>should actually be all those things at once.</em></p>\n<p>If such people <strong>even existed</strong>, \"full-stack\" developers <em>still</em> wouldn't be used as\nthey should. Rather than temporarily taking on <em>a single role</em> for a short period of time,\nthen transitioning into the next role, they are meant to be performing <strong>all the roles, all the time</strong>.\nAnd here's what really sucks: most good developers can almost pull this off.</p>\n<h2>The Totem Pole</h2>\n<p>Good developers are smart people. I know I'm going to get a ton of hate\nmail, but there <em>is</em> a hierarchy of usefulness of technology roles in an\norganization. Developer is at the top, followed by sysadmin and DBA. QA \nteams, \"operations\" people, release coordinators and the like are at the bottom \nof the totem pole. Why is it arranged like this? </p>\n<p><strong>Because each role can do the job of all roles below it if necessary.</strong></p>\n<p>Start-ups taught us this. Good developers can be passable DBAs if need be. They\nmake decent testers, \"deployment engineers\", and whatever other ridiculous term you'd\nlike to use. <em>Their job requires them to know much of the domain of \"lower\" roles.</em> \nThere's one big problem with this, and hopefully by now you see it:</p>\n<p><strong>It doesn't work in the opposite direction.</strong></p>\n<p>A QA person can't just do the job of a developer in a pinch, nor can a\nbuild-engineer do the job of a DBA. <em>They never acquired the specialized knowledge required to perform the role.</em>\nAnd that's fine. Like it or not, there are hierarchies in every organization, and people have \ndifferent skill sets and levels of ability. However, <em>when you make developers take on other roles, you don't have anyone to take on the role of development!</em></p>\n<p>An example will make this more clear. My dad is a dentist running his own\npractice. He employs a secretary, hygienist, and dental assistant. Under some\nsort of \"DentOps\" movement, my dad would be making appointments and cleaning\npeople's teeth while trying to find time to drill cavities, perform root canals, etc. My dad\n<em>can</em> do all of the other jobs in his office, because he has all the specialized\nknowledge required to do so. </p>\n<p><strong>But no one, not even all of his employees combined, can do his job.</strong></p>\n<p>Such a movement does a disservice to everyone involved, except (of course)\nemployers. What began as an experiment aimed at increasing software quality has\nbecome a farce, where the most talented employees are overworked (while doing\nless, less useful work) and lower-level positions simply don't exist.</p>\n<p>And this is the crux of the issue. All of the positions previously held by\npeople of various levels of ability are made redundant by the \"full-stack\"\nengineer. Large companies love this, as it means they can hire far fewer people\nto do the same amount of work. In the process, though, <em>actual development becomes a\nvanishingly small part of a developer's job</em>. This is why we see so many\ndevelopers that can't pass FizzBuzz: they never really had to write any code.\nAll too common a question now, can you imagine interviewing a chef and asking\nhim what portion of the day he actually devotes to cooking?</p>\n<h2>Jack of All Trades, Master of None</h2>\n<p>If you are a developer of moderately sized software, you need a deployment\nsystem in place. Quick, what are the benefits and drawbacks of the following\nsuch systems: Puppet, Chef, Salt, Ansible, Vagrant, Docker. Now implement your\ndeployment solution! Did you even realize which systems had no business being in\nthat list?</p>\n<p>We specialize for a reason: human beings are only capable of retaining so\nmuch knowledge. Task-switching is cognitively expensive. Forcing developers to take on additional roles traditionally performed by\nspecialists means that they:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>aren't spending their time developing</li>\n<li>need to keep up with an enormous domain of knowledge</li>\n<li>are going to burn out</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What's more, by forcing developers to take on \"full-stack\" responsibilities,\nthey are paying their employees far <em>more</em> than the market average for most of\nthose tasks. If a developer makes 100K a year, you can pay four developers 100K per year to do 50% development\nand 50% release management on a single, two-person task. Or, simply hire a release manager at, say, 75K and\n<em>two</em> developers who develop full-time. And notice the time wasted by developers\nwho are part time release-managers but don't always have releases to manage.</p>\n<h2>Don't Kill the Developer</h2>\n<p>The effect of all of this is to destroy the role of \"developer\" and replace it\nwith a sort of \"technology utility-player\". Every developer I know got into programming because they\nactually enjoyed doing it (at one point). You do a disservice to everyone\ninvolved when you force your brightest people to take on additional roles.</p>\n<p><strong>Not every company is a start-up.</strong> Start-ups don't make developers wear\nmultiple hats by choice, they do so out of necessity. Your company likely has\nenough resource constraints without you inventing some. Please, don't confuse\n\"being lean\" with \"running with the fewest possible employees\". And for God's\nsake, <strong>let developers write code!</strong></p>\n        \n<div class=\"sharing\">\n    <div class=\"row\">\n    \n    \n    <div id=\"mc_embed_signup\" class=\"well\">\n\n  <h4>Like this article?</h4>\n  <p>Why not sign up for <strong>Python Tutoring</strong>?

As a junior recruiter at the time a referral of this nature is perhaps best described as gold dust! So you can understand my excitement when the candidate in question agreed to meet for a coffee to discuss an exciting role at a leading high freq hedge-fund I was working with.</p>\n<p>I recall the candidate in question being perfect in every aspect (CompSci from top university, sound understanding of data structures, algorithms, complexity&#x2026;.coupled with actual practical programming experience, and oh yeah &#x2013; decent knowledge of Exotic Risk and Pricing). However, to my disappointed he was exclusively using a language that I had never heard of before&#x2026;.Haskell. What further compounded my disappointment was that despite the candidate wanting to look for something new, he would only consider functional programming based roles&#x2026;.so I searched, &#x2026;and&#x2026;came back with nothing!</p>\n<p>Today, just looking at job boards and speaking to various banking hiring managers, I am surprised at the sheer volume of functional programming and functional programming style roles available. So what has changed since 2006? What has promoted this continued rise of functional programming roles in the banking industry?</p>\n<p><strong>Why such an interest?</strong></p>\n<p>Today Functional programming in banking is no longer the hobby of a few. One major American bank is pushing a JVM based language that supports functional programming (Scala) as a firm-wide technology. Another two major banks are using Clojure for both real-time risk and pricing, and risk reporting. Speaking specifically to some of team members/the hiring manager of team that work on these Scala/Clojure roles, I am able to understand better why there is an increase in the interest in functional programming&#x2026;.below is my recruitment (non-technical) explanation&#x2026;..</p>\n<p><strong>Easier to write concurrent programs</strong></p>\n<p>Banking Trading systems and concurrency tend to go hand in hand. Whilst Java does provide concurrency concepts, &#x2026;.speaking to many Java developers across the several banks that have adopted (Scala/Clojure) there is an agreement that shared memory multi-threading approaches in Java cause more trouble than solving the problem. In other words, Concurrency certainly seems to be the major driving force, with &#x2018;imperative&#x2019; languages like java struggling due to having sequential statements and mutation so fundamentally baked-in. JVM based languages that do offer functional programming approach makes it very easy to write concurrent programs.</p>\n<p><strong>An industry built upon maths:</strong></p>\n<p>Another reason for the rise in functional programming in banking is due to the fact Banking is a business that is built upon mathematical functions and data transformations. Functional programming is closely modelled on proven mathematics, and of course mathematics is all about abstraction and composition. As such it is these vastly superior abstraction and composition techniques that functional programming give, which allow functional programming teams to cope with the complexity of large codebases and difficult problems.</p>\n<p><strong>Low risk and not so steep learning curve:</strong></p>\n<p>I appreciate there is some oragnisation risk with adopting&#x2026;&#x2026;.</p>\n<p>This is my personal opinion, but generally speaking what I have found is that technologists in general (banking or not) tend to be a progressive bunch. There is a need to do better, and to improve on what is in place already. What stops progressiveness is risk vs. reward. I mean why use/do something new that may disappear tomorrow and mean that the time spent would have been wasted? &#x2026;.I mean, look at Silverlight in 2009&#x2026; .banking went mental for it, paying super high contract rates, &#x2026;and now it&#x2019;s not even supported by Microsoft.</p>\n<p>However, I feel the rise of functional JVM based functional programming languages is due to their low risk. They are low risk simply because Scala/Clojure are built upon the JVM &#x2026;meaning if tomorrow Scala/Clojure become obsolete, you get to retain the JVM.</p>\n<p>Moreover, Clojure is based on LISP which has been around for a long time, and it&#x2019;s safe to say it will still be around in the future. Finally, whilst I have never coded, because Clojure/Scala is on the JVM it&#x2019;s very easy to pick up for a good Java developer.</p>\n<p><strong>Functional recruitment today:</strong></p>\n<p>I appreciate that I might have offended some people by not always making the distinction between functional and JVM based languages that support a functional programming style. I am aware that there is a clear distinction; however, for the purpose of describing the functional programming landscape today I am going to coin them together.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Scala: both being used in banking and some funds (high freq and systematic). I first started noticing adoption of Scala within these types of business in 2009, and if anything there has been a steady rise in its use; which doesn&#x2019;t appear to be stopping. Usage in the UK is probably half of that in the US (Palo Alto in particular).</li>\n<li>Clojure: used for risk and pricing applications for fixed income and for a brand new Greenfield risk reporting application. Unlike Scala this has seemingly come out of nowhere. Usage of Clojure remains slightly more popular here in UK and Europe more so than the US.</li>\n<li>Haskell: heavily used by three separate banks for their quant modelling groups. These are sometime business reporting groups and compared with IT reporting roles pay a lot better. However, open headcount in these teams are few and far between, and the roles are almost more suited to PHD students who have used Haskell heavily during their PHD work. The community is much smaller than that of other functional programming groups and key attendees of Haskell meet-ups are very well known to each other.</li>\n<li><em>OCaml</em>: some use in the systematic hedge-funds. Adoption of this language is very low, but like Haskell it&#x2019;s been around for a while making it a mature, stable language.</li>\n<li>F#: currently used by 3-4 funds casually, and also by 1-2 modelling quant groups. There was a big hype around it in 2007/8&#x2026;.but noise around it has died down somewhat.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>What does this mean for banking technologist today?</strong></p>\n<p>Unlike some extremist functional programmers I have spoken to, who make big, bold claims that Java is dead, I feel there is still a great deal of work to be done with OO Languages etc. For me as a technical recruiter trying to place strong candidates, nothing beats a strong grasp of an OO Language. With that said, those with time to spare after a hard day&#x2019;s work should spend a little time exploring functional programming. From what I am told it&#x2019;s interesting, addictive, and supposed to help improve OO skills. Moreover, What I find really interesting is that the mainstream industry seems now ready to take their languages in a Functional programming direction. This quote from Brain Goetz, the Oracle Java team lead, is particularly telling: <a href=\"http://wadler.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/brian-goetz-on-future-of-java.html?m=1\">http://wadler.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/brian-goetz-on-future-of-java.html?m=1</a> so to sum up, for I don&#x2019;t think there&#x2019;s any avoiding a hint of functional programming in banking for too long!</p>\n<p>By Abdul Muhit</p>\n<p>Linked In: http://uk.linkedin.com/in/abdulmuhit</p>\n<p>Email: <a href=\"mailto:abdul.muhit@oxfordknight.co.uk\">abdul.muhit@oxfordknight.co.uk</a></p>\n<p>Website: <a href=\"http://www.oxfordknight.co.uk/\">www.oxfordknight.co.uk</a></p>\n<p><strong><em>Oxford Knight is a technical recruitment agency.

This has been something of a saga, and has involved rather more late-night hacking than is probably good for me.</p>\n\n<h2>Book the First: Recalled to a life of strange build systems</h2>\n\n<p>You might not know it from the sheer bulk of uploads I do sometimes, but I actually don't speak a word of Haskell and it's not very high up my list of things to learn.  But I am a pretty experienced build engineer, and I enjoy porting things to new architectures: I'm firmly of the belief that breadth of architecture support is a good way to shake out certain categories of issues in code, that it's worth doing aggressively across an entire distribution, and that, even if you don't think you need something now, new requirements have a habit of coming along when you least expect them and you might as well be prepared in advance.  Furthermore, it annoys me when we have excessive noise in our <a href=\"http://qa.ubuntuwire.com/ftbfs/\">build failure</a> and <a href=\"https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ProposedMigration\">proposed-migration</a> output and I often put bits and pieces of spare time into gardening miscellaneous problems there, and at one point there was a lot of Haskell stuff on the list and it got a bit annoying to have to keep sending patches rather than just fixing things myself, and ... well, I ended up as probably the only non-Haskell-programmer on the Debian Haskell team and found myself fixing problems there in my free time.  Life is a bit weird sometimes.</p>\n\n<p>Bootstrapping packages on a new architecture is a bit of a black art that only a fairly small number of relatively bitter and twisted people know very much about.  Doing it in Ubuntu is specifically painful because we've always forbidden direct binary uploads: all binaries have to come from a build daemon.  Compilers in particular often tend to be written in the language they compile, and it's not uncommon for them to build-depend on themselves: that is, you need a previous version of the compiler to build the compiler, stretching back to the dawn of time where somebody put things together with a big magnet or something.  So how do you get started on a new architecture?  Well, what we do in this case is we construct a binary somehow (usually involving cross-compilation) and insert it as a build-dependency for a proper build in Launchpad.  The ability to do this is restricted to a small group of Canonical employees, partly because it's very easy to make mistakes and partly because things like the classic \"<a href=\"http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/ken/trust.html\">Reflections on Trusting Trust</a>\" are in the backs of our minds somewhere.  We have an iron rule for our own sanity that the injected build-dependencies must themselves have been built from the unmodified source package in Ubuntu, although there can be source modifications further back in the chain.  Fortunately, we don't need to do this very often, but it does mean that as somebody who can do it I feel an obligation to try and unblock other people where I can.</p>\n\n<p>As far as constructing those build-dependencies goes, sometimes we look for binaries built by other distributions (particularly Debian), and that's pretty straightforward.  In this case, though, these two architectures are pretty new and the Debian ports are only just getting going, and as far as I can tell none of the other distributions with active arm64 or ppc64el ports (or trivial name variants) has got as far as porting GHC yet.  Well, OK.  This was somewhere around the Christmas holidays and I had some time.  Muggins here cracks his knuckles and decides to have a go at bootstrapping it from scratch.  It can't be that hard, right?  Not to mention that it was a blocker for over 600 entries on that build failure list I mentioned, which is definitely enough to make me sit up and take notice; we'd even had the odd customer request for it.</p>\n\n<p>Several attempts later and I was starting to doubt my sanity, not least for trying in the first place.  We ship GHC 7.6, and upgrading to 7.8 is not a project I'd like to tackle until the much more experienced Haskell folks in Debian have switched to it in unstable.  The <a href=\"https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/Building/Porting\">porting documentation for 7.6</a> has bitrotted more or less beyond usability, and the <a href=\"https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/CrossCompilation\">corresponding documentation for 7.8</a> really isn't backportable to 7.6.  I tried building 7.8 for ppc64el anyway, picking that on the basis that we had quicker hardware for it and didn't seem likely to be particularly more arduous than arm64 (ho ho), and I even got to the point of having a cross-built stage2 compiler (stage1, in the cross-building case, is a GHC binary that runs on your starting architecture and generates code for your target architecture) that I could copy over to a ppc64el box and try to use as the base for a fully-native build, but it segfaulted incomprehensibly just after spawning any child process.  Compilers tend to do rather a lot, especially when they're built to use GCC to generate object code, so this was a pretty serious problem, and it resisted analysis.  I poked at it for a while but didn't get anywhere, and I had other things to do so declared it a write-off and gave up.</p>\n\n<h2>Book the Second: The golden thread of progress</h2>\n\n<p>In March, another mailing list conversation prodded me into finding a <a href=\"https://ghcarm.wordpress.com/2014/01/18/unregisterised-ghc-head-build-for-arm64-platform/\">blog entry by Karel Gardas</a> on building GHC for arm64.  This was enough to be worth another look, and indeed it turned out that (with some help from Karel in private mail) I was able to cross-build a compiler that actually worked and could be used to run a fully-native build that also worked.  Of course this was 7.8, since as I mentioned cross-building 7.6 is unrealistically difficult unless you're considerably more of an expert on GHC's labyrinthine build system than I am.  OK, no problem, right?  Getting a GHC at all is the hard bit, and 7.8 must be at least as capable as 7.6, so it should be able to build 7.6 easily enough ...</p>\n\n<p>Not so much.  What I'd missed here was that compiler engineers generally only care very much about building the compiler with <em>older</em> versions of itself, and if the language in question has any kind of deprecation cycle then the compiler itself is likely to be behind on various things compared to more typical code since it has to be buildable with older versions.  This means that the removal of some deprecated interfaces from 7.8 posed a problem, as did some changes in certain <acronym title=\"primitive operations\">primops</acronym> that had gained an associated compatibility layer in 7.8 but nobody had gone back to put the corresponding compatibility layer into 7.6.  GHC supports running Haskell code through the C preprocessor, and there's a <code>__GLASGOW_HASKELL__</code> definition with the compiler's version number, so this was just a slog tracking down changes in git and adding <code>#ifdef</code>-guarded code that coped with the newer compiler (remembering that stage1 will be built with 7.8 and stage2 with stage1, i.e. 7.6, from the same source tree).  More inscrutably, GHC has its own packaging system called Cabal which is also used by the compiler build process to determine which subpackages to build and how to link them against each other, and some crucial subpackages weren't being built: it looked like it was stuck on picking versions from \"stage0\" (i.e. the initial compiler used as an input to the whole process) when it should have been building its own.  Eventually I figured out that this was because GHC's use of its packaging system hadn't anticipated this case, and was selecting the higher version of the <code>ghc</code> package itself from stage0 rather than the version it was about to build for itself, and thus never actually tried to build most of the compiler.  Editing <code>ghc_stage1_DEPS</code> in <code>ghc/stage1/package-data.mk</code> after its initial generation sorted this out.  One late night building round and round in circles for a while until I had something stable, and a Debian source upload to add basic support for the architecture name (and other changes which were a bit over the top in retrospect: I didn't need to touch the embedded copy of libffi, as we build with the system one), and I was able to feed this all into Launchpad and watch the builders munch away very satisfyingly at the Haskell library stack for a while.</p>\n\n<p>This was all interesting, and finally all that work was actually paying off in terms of getting to watch a slew of several hundred build failures vanish from arm64 (the final count was something like 640, I think).  The fly in the ointment was that ppc64el was still blocked, as the problem there wasn't building 7.6, it was getting a working 7.8.  But now I really did have other much more urgent things to do, so I figured I just wouldn't get to this by release time and stuck it on the figurative shelf.</p>\n\n<h2>Book the Third: The track of a bug</h2>\n\n<p>Then, last Friday, I cleared out my urgent pile and thought I'd have another quick look.  (I get a bit obsessive about things like this that smell of \"interesting intellectual puzzle\".)  slyfox on the #ghc IRC channel gave me some general debugging advice and, particularly usefully, a reduced example program that I could use to debug just the process-spawning problem without having to wade through noise from running the rest of the compiler.  I reproduced the same problem there, and then found that the program crashed earlier (in <code>stg_ap_0_fast</code>, part of the run-time system) if I compiled it with <code>+RTS -Da -RTS</code>.  I nailed it down to a small enough region of assembly that I could see all of the assembly, the source code, and an intermediate representation or two from the compiler, and then started meditating on what makes ppc64el special.</p>\n\n<p>You see, the vast majority of porting bugs come down to what I might call gross properties of the architecture.  You have things like whether it's 32-bit or 64-bit, big-endian or little-endian, whether <code>char</code> is signed or unsigned, that sort of thing.  There's a <a href=\"https://wiki.debian.org/ArchitectureSpecificsMemo\">big table</a> on the Debian wiki that handily summarises most of the important ones.  Sometimes you have to deal with distribution-specific things like whether GL or GLES is used; often, especially for new variants of existing architectures, you have to cope with foolish configure scripts that think they can guess certain things from the architecture name and get it wrong (assuming that <code>powerpc*</code> means big-endian, for instance).  We often have to update <code>config.guess</code> and <code>config.sub</code>, and on ppc64el we have the additional hassle of updating libtool macros too.  But I've done a lot of this stuff and I'd accounted for everything I could think of.  ppc64el is actually a lot like amd64 in terms of many of these porting-relevant properties, and not even that far off arm64 which I'd just successfully ported GHC to, so I couldn't be dealing with anything particularly obvious.  There was some hand-written assembly which certainly could have been problematic, but I'd carefully checked that this wasn't being used by the \"unregisterised\" (no specialised machine dependencies, so relatively easy to port but not well-optimised) build I was using.  A problem around spawning processes suggested a problem with <code>SIGCHLD</code> handling, but I ruled that out by slowing down the first child process that it spawned and using <code>strace</code> to confirm that <code>SIGSEGV</code> was the first signal received.  What on earth was the problem?</p>\n\n<p>From some painstaking gdb work, one thing I eventually noticed was that <code>stg_ap_0_fast</code>'s local stack appeared to be being corrupted by a function call, specifically a call to the colourfully-named <code>debugBelch</code>.  Now, when IBM's toolchain engineers were putting together ppc64el based on ppc64, they took the opportunity to fix a number of problems with their ABI: there's an <a href=\"https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8035647\">OpenJDK bug</a> with a handy list of references.  One of the things I noticed there was that there were some <a href=\"http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2013-11/msg01149.html\">stack allocation optimisations</a> in the new ABI, which affected functions that don't call any vararg functions and don't call any functions that take enough parameters that some of them have to be passed on the stack rather than in registers.  <code>debugBelch</code> takes varargs: hmm.  Now, the calling code isn't quite in C as such, but in a related dialect called \"Cmm\", a variant of C-- (yes, minus), that GHC uses to help bridge the gap between the functional world and its code generation, and which is compiled down to C by GHC.  When importing C functions into Cmm, GHC generates prototypes for them, but it doesn't do enough parsing to work out the true prototype; instead, they all just get something like <code>extern StgFunPtr f(void);</code>.  In most architectures you can get away with this, because the arguments get passed in the usual calling convention anyway and it all works out, but on ppc64el this means that the caller doesn't generate enough stack space and then the callee tries to save its varargs onto the stack in an area that in fact belongs to the caller, and suddenly everything goes south.  Things were starting to make sense.</p>\n\n<p>Now, <code>debugBelch</code> is only used in optional debugging code; but <code>runInteractiveProcess</code> (the function associated with the initial round of failures) takes no fewer than twelve arguments, plenty to force some of them onto the stack.  I poked around the GCC patch for this ABI change a bit and determined that it only optimised away the stack allocation if it had a full prototype for all the callees, so I guessed that changing those prototypes to <code>extern StgFunPtr f();</code> might work: it's still technically wrong, not least because omitting the parameter list is an obsolescent feature in C11, but it's at least just omitting information about the parameter list rather than actively lying about it.  I tweaked that and ran the cross-build from scratch again.  Lo and behold, suddenly I had a working compiler, and I could go through the same build-7.6-using-7.8 procedure as with arm64, much more quickly this time now that I knew what I was doing.  One <a href=\"https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/8965\">upstream bug</a>, one Debian upload, and several bootstrapping builds later, and GHC was up and running on another architecture in Launchpad.  Success!</p>\n\n<h2>Epilogue</h2>\n\n<p>There's still more to do.  I gather there may be a Google Summer of Code project in Linaro to write proper native code generation for GHC on arm64: this would make things a good deal faster, but also enable GHCi (the interpreter) and Template Haskell, and thus clear quite a few more build failures.  Since there's already native code generation for ppc64 in GHC, getting it going for ppc64el would probably only be a couple of days' work at this point.  But these are niceties by comparison, and I'm more than happy with what I got working for 14.04.</p>\n\n<p>The upshot of all of this is that I may be the first non-Haskell-programmer to ever port GHC to two entirely new architectures.  I'm not sure if I gain much from that personally aside from a lot of lost sleep and being considered extremely strange.  It has, however, been by far the most challenging set of packages I've ported, and a fascinating trip through some odd corners of build systems and undefined behaviour that I don't normally need to touch.</p>\n\n<p>\n<i>[<a href=\"http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/ucgi/~cjwatson/blosxom\"></a>] \n<a href=\"http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/ucgi/~cjwatson/blosxom/2014-04-15-porting-ghc-a-tale-of-two-architectures.html\">permanent link</a></i>\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n  </td>\n\n  </div>","related":{}},"22":{"title":"Aesthetic vs. Design","content":"<div><div class=\"post\">\n\t    \t<div class=\"clip\">\n <img src=\"http://patrickalgrim.me/assets/vw-bus.png\" class=\"wide\">\n</div>\n\n<p>What if I tried to sell you a really pretty looking car without an engine?

It's the basis for wild\nspeculation that nefarious actors were exploiting this vulnerability before\nit was disclosed on the Monday. An example is this article from EFF:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/04/wild-heart-were-intelligence-agencies-using-heartbleed-november-2013\">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/04/wild-heart-were-intelligence-agencies-using-heartbleed-november-2013</a></p>\n\n<p>Likewise, a lot of people are confused by error messages in their server logs\nabout SSL sessions being aborted during handshake. This is an artifact of lots\nof tools. For example, my <code>masscan</code> port scanner causes that during a normal\nSSL banner check.</p>\n\n<p>Had anybody been exploiting the bug early, before Monday's public announcement,\nit's unlikely they would have been doing things this way. A far easier way is the\nmethod demonstrated in this program, which doesn't generate the above pattern\nor log file entries.</p>\n\n<p>The technique is to grab the OpenSSL library and do a custom build. Go into the\nfile <code>t1_lib.c</code> and change line# 2671 like the following:</p>\n\n<p><code>-    s2n(payload, p);</code></p>\n\n<p><code>+  s2n(0x4444, p);</code></p>\n\n<p>In this example, <code>0x4444</code> is the number I've chosen arbitrarily as the number\nof bytes I want to get back, which is about 16kilobytes.</p>\n\n<p>Once you've made that change to the OpenSSL build, then link the attached C\nprogram. All this program does is establish a normal session, then send a heartbeat,\nthen dump the hex of the heartbeat message.</p>\n\n<p>The thing with this program is that it does the heartbeat AFTER the handshake has\ncompleted, so it won't produce those log messages. Also, while the fact this is \na hearbeat is still exposed view SSL's \"record\" header, the contents are encrypted,\ngiving fewer bytes for an IDS to trigger on.</p>\n\n<p>If you look at the bytes sent, you'll now see something like the following on the\nrequest, where the bytes afterwards are encrypted and therefore meaningless:</p>\n\n<p><code>18 03 03 00 3d</code></p>\n\n<p>On the response side, you'll see something like the following:</p>\n\n<p><code>18 03 03 44 5C</code></p>\n\n<p>The problem here is that there aren't really enough bytes here for an IDS to pattern-match\non. The final two bytes are \"length\" field and can be arbitrarly chosen by a hacker, especially\nif they want to evade an IDS. That leaves only the first three bytes being meaningful,\nand they'll false positive in about one in 4-million SSL packets -- which on a busy network\nwould be quite often.</p>\n\n<p>The only way to properly detect this for an IDS is to do a stateful protocol-analysis instead\nof a pattern-match. A demonstration of this is in <code>masscan</code> which does a full SSL decode in\norder to detect this issue (albeit with a truncated SSL stack). The <code>masscan</code> state-machine\ndecoders can easily be copied into an IDS.</p>\n\n<p>As for conspiracy theories about early exploitation, this is the sort of program I would have\nwritten, and I assume it's the sort of program that any competent organization (e.g. the NSA)\nwould have writtent to exploit this bug. Therefore, if you are seeing things that look like\ncurrent patterns that happened months ago, I'm betting it's false positives and not real\nexploitation.</p>\n\n<h2>\n<a name=\"user-content-snort\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/heartleech#snort\"></a>Snort</h2>\n\n<p>Since posting this, people have told me about the following blog from Snort's VRT team:</p>\n\n<pre><code>http://vrt-blog.snort.org/2014/04/performing-heartbleed-attack-after-tls.html?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Firstly, this shows exactly my point: early exploiters would've (probably) have done\ntheir attacks AFTER the handshake, not before.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, while their signatures are better than EmergingThreat signatures, they\naren't sufficient.

Because if you aren&#x2019;t careful, you&#x2019;ll actually just be giving away your product for Free!</p>\n\n<h2>Reason #1: &#x2018;Free&#x2019; Is Not A Competitive Advantage In Business</h2>\n<p>One of the most prominent details we emphasized to everyone we spoke to in the early days of Trak.io was that we would offer a super generous Free plan. A free plan so generous that an average funded startup would very rarely outgrow it.</p>\n<p>We would have floods of users dropping our competition, ripping out their old code integrations, and flocking to Trak.io because we would be Free. Free as in air.</p>\n<p>We thought that the monthly cost, whether it was $0 or $499 per month, was how all startups chose their SaaS software (wrong!).</p>\n<p>&#x2018;Free&#x2019; is not competitive advantage because your competition could easily do the same thing overnight. There&#x2019;s no proprietary algorithm involved. No charismatic user interface to create. They just add a free plan overnight, and section off a bunch of cashflow to cover the burn.</p>\n<p>If your competitors can copy you overnight, it was never a competitive advantage.</p>\n<h2>Reason #2: Free Users Help You To Build A Cool Product.&#xA0;Paying Customers Help You To Develop A Valuable Product</h2>\n<p>After introducing our $29 Priority Access program, offering Beta waiting list subscribers an instant queue jump, we started to see a huge shift in our customer development. Features that we&#x2019;d previously emphasized because everyone said they were &#x2018;cool&#x2019; no longer came up in conversations.</p>\n<p>Instead, we started to hear about more &#x2018;mundane&#x2019; ideas, but they had direct business value. People started asking about scenarios we&#x2019;d just not thought about. Our paid queue jump users asked for Salesforce integrations. Multi-permission multi-colleague access. Custom data exports. Easier integration&#x2019;s so marketing didn&#x2019;t need to pester IT as much.</p>\n<p>In contrast, our free beta users had suggested more icons for the metrics dashboard. For the ability to upload individual customer photos. For custom colour coding labels.</p>\n<p>I&#x2019;m not saying that free Beta users aren&#x2019;t valuable. Neither am I saying that paying customers are the best way to innovate creatively as an entrepreneur. But, if you want to build something that people will pay for, then you should pay close attention to what your paying customers ask for.</p>\n<h2>Reason #3: Free Users Require The Most Support</h2>\n<p>Generally speaking, our Beta users who couldn&#x2019;t justify a $29 expense on their business credit card, also couldn&#x2019;t justify having their freelancer, agency or developer to integrate Trak.io into their app.</p>\n<p>Thats ok. We have a pretty outdated integration process that we&#x2019;re working on, and while we don&#x2019;t have any automated data capture tools or plugins, we&#x2019;re happy to help people write code. Literally, I&#x2019;ve written the entire custom Javascript for dozens of applications so that people can jump straight into Trak.io.</p>\n<p>But that takes quite a lot of time. And usually, those users are the ones who need the most hand-holding through the first few days of using the tool too.</p>\n<p>In stark contrast, the feedback we usually get from our paying customers is &#x201C;Installation was a breeze for our developer&#x201D; or &#x201C;Point us to your documentation, Mike (our CTO) will sort the rest&#x201D;.</p>\n<p>Our paying users just had more resources available to benefit the most from Trak.io with minimum input from us. A junior/mid developer capable of delivering suitable Trak.io customer support will cost us around $100-$200 <strong>per hour</strong> (if we hired someone). With a SaaS product costing only $9-$299 <strong>per month</strong>, we need to ensure we&#x2019;re able to support <strong>all</strong> our users without burning tons of money in support staff.</p>\n<p>At current count, we have 1,460 users registered with Trak.io. Some of those are still free users from the Beta who have a couple of weeks to decide to pay, or leave the platform. Quite simply, there&#x2019;s no way that with our current team of 3 people, we could support 1,460 users effectively and to the level they expect from us.</p>\n<p>But, if that user count was a more manageable number in the hundreds, and those users were paying us, not only could I continue to personally say hello to each user to welcome and onboard them, we could also hire a dedicated support member of staff.</p>\n<h2>Reason #4: We Don&#x2019;t See Any Viral Benefit Of Thousands Of Free Users Telling Thousands Of Other Free Users About Us</h2>\n<p>Having thousands of users talking about your product is great. But not if all of those users only talk about your product because it&#x2019;s free.</p>\n<p>Honestly, how many people would you refer to Google analytics if it cost you $49 a month? Probably zero. It&#x2019;s not saying much about a B2B product if it can&#x2019;t add more than $49 of value to your business a month.</p>\n<p>When a &#x2018;forever free&#x2019; user refers one of their buddies because &#x201C;Oh yeah it&#x2019;s a free analytics product!&#x201D;, do you think that new person is going to become a paying customer?</p>\n<p>Having 10,000 free users who have no intention of ever paying you is not freemium. It&#x2019;s just a free product.</p>\n<p>We don&#x2019;t want our viral engines of growth to rely on the fact that our product is free. We want users to refer their peers because we bring <strong>massive value to their business</strong>, an order of magnitude more than the couple of bucks a month we charge them.</p>\n<h2>Reason #5: We Get No Value From Their Data</h2>\n<p>At Trak.io, we aren&#x2019;t selling aggregated data from the millions of people our software is tracking. We just provide the platform. The data belongs entirely to our respective customers who stored it with us.</p>\n<p>Other analytics companies (and a few other B2B SaaS platforms in different industries) offer a free service in exchange for you giving them total access to resell and use your data. They take the aggregate data (or cookies), and sell it to the highest bidder &#x2013; usually market research firms or ad-targeting networks.</p>\n<p>We think thats just creepy.</p>\n<p>Because we don&#x2019;t do any &#x2018;backdoor sales&#x2019;, there&#x2019;s no way we could monetize the data that our free users would bring to the platform.</p>\n<h2>Reason #6: We Want To Build A Sustainable Business Around A Product People Love (Enough To Pay For It)</h2>\n<p>The success stories of Freemium usually get a lot of spotlight. However, no one really talks about the cases where freemium bankrupted startups. Or crippled a startups efforts to monetize their product later (because everyone was so used to it being free).</p>\n<p>People love to point out Mailchimp&#x2019;s freemium model:</p>\n<p><em>&#x201C;They&#x2019;re worth a Billion dollars and they have a <a href=\"https://blog.mailchimp.com/weve-doubled-our-freemium-plan-yes-again/\"><span>huge</span></a> free plan!&#x201D;</em></p>\n<p>What they fail to miss, is that Mailchimp launched in 2001 and spent 7 years building a massive product with tons of features, and built up to 85,000 paying customers, before <a href=\"http://blog.mailchimp.com/going-freemium-one-year-later/\">introducing a free plan in 2008.</a>&#xA0;It actually took them a few years to even offer a free trial!</p>\n<p>Once you have a product people love enough to pay for, you have a healthy cashflow, and you&#x2019;re confident there&#x2019;s a viral engine of growth in your product&#x2026; thats when you should consider introducing a freemium model in your B2B business.</p>\n<p>If you&#x2019;re in B2B, you need to focus on building a solid, sustainable business built around a product people love.</p>\n<h2>Reason #7: We Totally Changed Our Pricing Metrics, and Miscalculated Our Costs</h2>\n<p>During the Beta, we hinted to users that our pricing would look something like this:</p>\n<p><em>Free, $29, $49, $149</em></p>\n<p>At launch, our pricing now looks like this:</p>\n<p><em>$9, $49, $149, $299</em></p>\n<p>Initially, we were going to offer only 6 months data retention (we figured startups only care about short term data) which meant our costs were pretty much based around only keeping a few terrabytes on high spec servers at a time.</p>\n<p>In reality though, we learned real businesses want to have the peace of mind of knowing they can run annual reports on their data and compare Q1 this year to Q1 last year.</p>\n<p>This meant we instantly had to double all our assumptions on server costs!</p>\n<p>We also intended to charge based on the number of visitors to your website/app. We soon realised this was a metric totally uncorrelated to the revenue or success of a product, and scaling on that just wasn&#x2019;t a meaningful value-based metric.</p>\n<p>As this meant we would now be storing a lot more data for an average account, as we were now storing potentially millions of anonymous visitors data, we had to increase our server cost estimates again.</p>\n<p>Also throwing our cost estimates off were assumptions about how many events an average app would track. With similar products like KISSmetrics and Mixpanel, you&#x2019;re charged on the number of data points you store. While this does have a a direct correlation to <strong>our costs</strong>, we soon realised it was unrelated to the <strong>business value</strong> the user gained, and actually created a bit of anxiety when users were first integrating:</p>\n<p><em>&#x201C;Which events should we track, we don&#x2019;t want to track too many things because of the event storage limits!&#x201D;</em></p>\n<p>In reality, I want our users to track as much as possible because they&#x2019;re going to kick themselves in 3 months when they learn about a problem in a workflow, but they didn&#x2019;t track every individual step in that particular process.</p>\n<h2>In Summary</h2>\n<p>I&#x2019;m not trying to say that a B2B SaaS app shouldn&#x2019;t ever consider Freemium. And I&#x2019;m not saying there aren&#x2019;t great examples of it working.</p>\n<p>I&#x2019;m also fully aware that we&#x2019;ve pissed off a lot of our very early Beta users by dropping our free plan.</p>\n<p>However, I am saying you should really analyse your reasons for choosing freemium, and make sure you aren&#x2019;t actually choosing &#x2018;Free&#x2019;. Free is just a vanity growth number that&#x2019;s going to burn a hole in your cash.</p>\n<p>Freemium should be a customer acquisition tactic.</p>\n<p>We think the introduction of our <a href=\"http://trak.io/pricing.html\">$9 Solo plan</a> will allow us to separate the free users who have no intention of ever paying for software, from the early-stage Bootstrappers, and we&#x2019;re pretty happy with the decision so far!</p>\n<p><strong>Please leave a comment if you&#x2019;ve had to approach the &#x2018;Freemium vs. Free&#x2019; decision in your startup!</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>UPDATE Tues 5th April 2014: &#xA0;</strong>Edited to remove the term &#x2018;Freeloaders&#x2019; after a few readers correctly pointed out this was a pretty douchebag term to use, especially when WE were the ones who put the product out for free in the first place!

But this month, we learned that Snowden used another technology to keep his communications out of the NSA&#x2019;s prying eyes. It&#x2019;s called Tails. And naturally, nobody knows exactly who created it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://tails.boum.org\">Tails</a> is a kind of computer-in-a-box. You install it on a DVD or USB drive, boot up the computer from the drive and, <em>voila</em>, you&#x2019;re pretty close to anonymous on the internet. At its heart, Tails is a version of the Linux operating system optimized for anonymity. It comes with several privacy and encryption tools, most notably Tor, an application that anonymizes a user&#x2019;s internet traffic by routing it through a network of computers run by volunteers around the world.</p>\n<p>Snowden, Greenwald and their collaborator, documentary film maker Laura Poitras, used it because, by design, Tails doesn&#x2019;t store any data locally. This makes it virtually immune to malicious software, and prevents someone from performing effective forensics on the computer after the fact. That protects both the journalists, and often more importantly, their sources. </p>\n<p>&#x201C;The installation and verification has a learning curve to make sure it is installed correctly,&#x201D; Poitras told WIRED by e-mail. &#x201C;But once the set up is done, I think it is very easy to use.&#x201D; </p>\n<h2>An Operating System for Anonymity</h2>\n<p>Originally developed as a research project by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, Tor has been used by a wide range of people who care about online anonymity: everyone from Silk Road drug dealers, to activists, whistleblowers, stalking victims and people who simply like their online privacy.</p>\n<p>Tails makes it much easier to use Tor and other privacy tools. Once you boot into Tails &#x2014; which requires no special setup &#x2014; Tor runs automatically. When you&#x2019;re done using it, you can boot back into your PC&#x2019;s normal operating system, and no history from your Tails session will remain.</p>\n<div class=\"pullquote-left\">&#x2018;The masters of today&#x2019;s Internet&#x2026; really want our lives to be more and more transparent online, and this is only for their own benefit.&#x2019;\n<p>&#x2014;  The Tails Development Team</p>\n</div>\n<p>The developers of Tails are, appropriately, anonymous. All of WIREDS&#x2019;s questions were collectively &#x2014; and anonymously &#x2014; answered by the group&#x2019;s members via email.</p>\n<p>They&#x2019;re protecting their identities, in part, to help protect the code from government interference. &#x201C;The NSA has been pressuring free software projects and developers in various ways,&#x201D; the group says, referring to a <a href=\"http://linux.slashdot.org/story/13/09/19/0227238/linus-torvalds-admits-hes-been-asked-to-insert-backdoor-into-linux\">a conference last year</a> at which Linux creator Linus Torvalds implied that the NSA had asked him to place a backdoor in the operating system.</p>\n<p>But the Tails team is also trying to strike a blow against the widespread erosion of online privacy. &#x201C;The masters of today&#x2019;s Internet, namely the marketing giants like Google, Facebook, and Yahoo, and the spying agencies, really want our lives to be more and more transparent online, and this is only for their own benefit,&#x201D; the group says. &#x201C;So trying to counterbalance this tendency seems like a logical position for people developing an operating system that defends privacy and anonymity online.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>But since we don&#x2019;t know who wrote Tails, how do we now it isn&#x2019;t some government plot designed to snare activists or criminals? A couple of ways, actually. One of the Snowden leaks show the NSA complaining about Tails in a Power Point Slide; if it&#x2019;s bad for the NSA, it&#x2019;s safe to say it&#x2019;s good for privacy.  And all of the Tails code is open source, so it can be inspected by anyone worried about foul play. &#x201C;Some of us simply believe that our work, what we do, and how we do it, should be enough to trust Tails, without the need of us using our legal names,&#x201D; the group says.</p>\n<p>According to the group, Tails began five years ago. &#x201C;At that time some of us were already Tor enthusiasts and had been involved in free software communities for years,&#x201D; they says. &#x201C;But we felt that something was missing to the panorama: a toolbox that would bring all the essential privacy enhancing technologies together and made them ready to use and accessible to a larger public.&#x201D; </p>\n<p>The developers initially called their project Amnesia and based it on an existing operating system called Incognito. Soon the Amnesia and Incognito projects merged into Tails, which stands for The Amnesic Incognito Live System.</p>\n<p>And while the core Tails group focuses on developing the operating system for laptops and desktop computers, a separate group is making a <a href=\"https://dev.guardianproject.info/projects/libro/wiki/Tomy_Detachable_Secure_Mobile_System\">mobile version</a> that can run on Android and Ubuntu tablets, provided the user has root access to the device.</p>\n<h2>Know Your Limitations</h2>\n<p>In addition to Tor, Tails includes privacy tools like PGP, the password management system KeePassX, and the chat encryption plugin Off-the-Record. But Tails doesn&#x2019;t just bundle a bunch of off the shelf tools into a single package. Many of the applications have been modified to improve the privacy of its users.</p>\n<p>But no operating system or privacy tool can guarantee complete protection in all situations. </p>\n<p>Although Tails includes productivity applications like OpenOffice, GIMP and Audacity, it doesn&#x2019;t make a great everyday operating system. That&#x2019;s because over the course of day-to-day use, you&#x2019;re likely to use service or another that could be linked with your identity, blowing your cover entirely. Instead, Tails should only be used for the specific activities that need to be kept anonymous, and nothing else.</p>\n<p>The developers list several other <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/doc/about/warning/\">security warnings</a> in the site documentation.</p>\n<p>Of course the group is constantly working to fix security issues, and they&#x2019;re always looking for volunteers to help with the project. They&#x2019;ve also applied for a grant from the Knight Foundation, and are collecting <a href=\"https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/organization/tails\">donations</a> via the Freedom of the Press Foundation, the group that <a href=\"https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/blog/2014/04/help-support-little-known-privacy-tool-has-been-critical-journalists-reporting-nsa\">first disclosed Tails&#x2019;s role in the Snowden story.</a></p>\n<p>That money could go a long way toward helping journalists &#x2014; and others &#x2014; stay away from the snoops. Reporters, after all, aren&#x2019;t always the most tech-savvy people. As <em>Washington Post</em> reporter Barton Gellman told the Freedom of the Press Foundation, &#x201C;Tails puts the essential tools in one place, with a design that makes it hard to screw them up. I could not have talked to Edward Snowden without this kind of protection. I wish I&#x2019;d had it years ago.&#x201D;</p>\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n</div><hr class=\"rdb-page-break\" /><div><div class=\"entry\">\n\t\t\t\n<div class=\"gallery-wrap lazy-load-off\">\n\t<div class=\"wp35-gallery regular\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t   \n\n\t\t\n\t\t</div> \n\t</div>\n<div><div class=\"slide\"><img title=\"\" alt=\"\" width=\"650px\" src=\"http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Collection.jpg\"><p class=\"caption\">Invasione Creativa's cards draw attention to every popular character's best skills.

We wanted to ask the guys at Johammer about the design, but no one replied to our inquiries.</p>\n<p>The designer also 86&#x2032;d the gauges in favor of a display in the mirrors. Propulsion comes from an 11 kilowatt hub-mounted motor. That&#x2019;s all of 14 horsepower&#x2013;in a bike that weighs 350 pounds. So it&#x2019;s slow. Really slow. But people will have plenty of time to gawk as you roll past.</p>\n<p>The J1.150 comes with an 8.3 kilowatt hour battery pack, which Johammer claims is good for just over 93 miles. The more expensive J1.200, which weighs 400 pounds, sports a 12.7 kWh pack with a range of 124 miles. Both models have regenerative braking and a single-stage &#x201C;twist-and-go&#x201D; gearbox.</p>\n<p>The J1.150 is on sale for just under $32,000, and the J1.200 is selling for just under $35,000.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/vWtwTrta0Zg\" height=\"371\" width=\"660\"></iframe></p>\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n</div><hr class=\"rdb-page-break\" /><div><div class=\"entry\">\n\t\t\t\n<p>With the rise of digital cameras and smartphone photography, we lost photo albums&#x2013;the actual, physical things we relied on to hold our memories. In their place, we have the photo apps that come preinstalled on our smartphones. It definitely seems like a bit of a downgrade.</p>\n<p>But if you listen to Gentry Underwood, the designer who led the development of Dropbox&#x2019;s new photo app, <a href=\"https://www.carousel.com/\">Carousel</a>, there&#x2019;s a lot to love about today&#x2019;s photo apps. They&#x2019;re simple, responsive, incredibly easy to use. They keep our cherished memories just a few flicks away. </p>\n<p>There&#x2019;s just one problem with those stock photo apps, as Underwood sees it. They make it seem like your life started the last time you bought a smartphone.</p>\n<p class=\"pullquote-left\">The faster you&#x2019;re going, the crummier the thumbnails it can serve up without you noticing.</p>\n<p>Carousel aims to solve that short term memory problem. The idea is to give people a simple tool for revisiting all their photos&#x2013;not just the ones they&#x2019;ve snapped with their most recent device. Underwood, whose popular email app Mailbox was acquired by Dropbox for somewhere in the ballpark of $100 million last year, says the goal was taking the photos that exist as &#x201C;stacks of files on your computer&#x201D; and bringing them into an app where they could actually be enjoyed.</p>\n<p>On one level, that&#x2019;s a huge technical undertaking. We&#x2019;re amassing more pictures than ever&#x2013;more than you could ever keep stored on a single mobile device. To sidestep this storage issue, Carousel seamlessly integrates images snapped on your phone with those stored in your Dropbox, combining them into one massive collection. The hard part is making it seem like everything&#x2019;s stored locally. That after all is what keeps those photo apps feeling so snappy in the first place.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We wanted it to feel like a no compromise experience,&#x201D; Underwood says. &#x201C;And that took a ton of work&#x2013;just a ton of work&#x2013;to get there.&#x201D;</p>\n<h4><strong>A Perceptual Trick</strong></h4>\n<p>In large part, that work involves fine-tuned caching and other heavy geekery. But there&#x2019;s also some clever perceptual trickery that went into Carousel&#x2019;s UX. For example, the app saves multiple thumbnails for each photo at various resolutions and deploys them depending on how fast you&#x2019;re scrolling through your collection. The faster you&#x2019;re going, the crummier the thumbnails it can serve up without you noticing. </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_714661\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/underwood.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/underwood.jpg\" alt=\"Gentry Underwood.

In Carousel, your photos are automatically sorted into events based on time and location. That way, the app can condense events with a huge number of shots, so you won&#x2019;t need to swipe past all two hundred pictures your kid&#x2019;s birthday party every time you&#x2019;re looking for something that came before it. A smart horizontal scroll bar on the bottom of the screen offers an even quicker way to scrub through your collection chronologically. </p>\n<h4><strong>Giving Every Smile a Score</strong></h4>\n<p>Even more ingenious is the way Carousel surfaces photos it thinks you&#x2019;re most likely to want to see. To start, the app scans every photograph in your collection for human faces. Based on the qualities of the mugs it detects, it assigns each picture a &#x201C;smile score.&#x201D; The one with the highest ranking for a given event is displayed with a double-size thumbnail, serving as a sort of hero shot for that subset of pics.</p>\n<p>That simple feature, Underwood says, instantly elevates the app from a basic photo viewer to something more meaningful. &#x201C;I kind of lost it the first time I saw it in action,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;Because for the first time my gallery felt alive. It&#x2019;s sort of a little idea, but that little idea has a dramatic impact.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>That smile score is the rare feature that can lend an emotional layer to our generally unfeeling software. Instead of treating each image the same, Carousel attempts to identify the pictures that will actually evoke a positive response. &#x201C;If you think about the ones that are going to give you the biggest hit of seratonin and dopamine, it&#x2019;s the photos where a loved one or a friend is looking back at you,&#x201D; Underwood says. That&#x2019;s one big step toward solving that &#x201C;stack of files&#x201D; problem.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_714641\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/carousel.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/carousel-660x495.jpg\" alt=\"Photo Illustration: WIRED\" width=\"660\" class=\"size-660-single-full wp-image-714641\"></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Photo Illustration: WIRED</em></figcaption></div>\n<h4><strong>Curating Instead of Deleting</strong></h4>\n<p>The other subtle departure from standard mobile photo apps comes in the simple tools Carousel offers for organizing your collection. After tapping on a photo to see it full size, you can either swipe up to add it to a sharable group of images or swipe down to hide it from your collection.</p>\n<p>A &#x201C;hide&#x201D; feature might not seem like an especially exciting inclusion, but it&#x2019;s hugely useful&#x2013;and something that&#x2019;s missing from most stock photo apps. With its original photo app, Apple established a model where your only option was to delete photos. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a 100% destructive thing,&#x201D; Underwood says. It&#x2019;s also a heavy, two-step interaction; you have to tap the trash can and then tap again to confirm your intentions. As a result, many people don&#x2019;t delete at all&#x2013;and consequently have photo rolls stuffed with misfires, blurry selfies, and eight not-quite-right versions of the same shot.</p>\n<p>The swipe-to-hide function, Underwood says, was part of an effort to give people tools for &#x201C;lightweight, easy curation.&#x201D; It&#x2019;s the same type of simple interaction that fueled the success of Mailbox, which set itself apart from other mobile email apps with a clever swipe-driven sorting system.</p>\n<p>The version of Carousel that arrived last week is very much a version 1.0, Underwood says, and we can expect to see more in the future. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s a ton of opportunity here,&#x201D; he explains. &#x201C;A lot of it is very difficult to get right.&#x201D; </p>\n<p>He&#x2019;s not wrong. Reinventing the photo album for the digital age will take both sharp UI smarts and a mastery of cloud-based storage. Fortunately for us, that&#x2019;s exactly what Underwood and Dropbox have going for them.</p>\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n</div><hr class=\"rdb-page-break\" /><div><div class=\"entry\">\n\t\t\t\n<div class=\"gallery-wrap lazy-load-off\">\n\t<div class=\"wp35-gallery regular\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t   \n\n\t\t\n\t\t</div> \n\t</div>\n<div><div class=\"slide\"><img title=\"\" alt=\"\" width=\"650px\" src=\"http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/btc001.jpg\"><p class=\"caption\">A man wears a necklace made out of silver and gold minted into coins containing the private keys to 65 bitcoins.<span class=\"credit\"> Photo by: Megan Miller </span></p><div class=\"desc\"><p>A man wears a necklace made out of silver and gold minted into coins containing the private keys to 65 bitcoins.</p><span class=\"credit\"> Photo by: Megan Miller </span></div></div><div class=\"slide\"><img title=\"\" alt=\"\" width=\"650px\" src=\"http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/btc002.jpg\"><p class=\"caption\">A man who grows and sells his own marijuana accepts bitcoin as payment because the currency can't be easily traced.<span class=\"credit\"> Photo by: Megan Miller </span></p><div class=\"desc\"><p>A man who grows and sells his own marijuana accepts bitcoin as payment because the currency can't be easily traced.</p><span class=\"credit\"> Photo by: Megan Miller </span></div></div><div class=\"slide\"><img title=\"\" alt=\"\" width=\"650px\" src=\"http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/btc004.jpg\"><p class=\"caption\">A physical bitcoin along with a collection of silver.<span class=\"credit\"> Photo by: Megan Miller </span></p><div class=\"desc\"><p>A physical bitcoin along with a collection of silver.</p><span class=\"credit\"> Photo by: Megan Miller </span></div></div><div class=\"slide\"><img title=\"\" alt=\"\" width=\"650px\" src=\"http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/btc005.jpg\"><p class=\"caption\">A man setting up a new bitcoin mining rig.<span class=\"credit\"> Photo by: Megan Miller </span></p><div class=\"desc\"><p>A man setting up a new bitcoin mining rig.</p><span class=\"credit\"> Photo by: Megan Miller </span></div></div><div class=\"slide\"><img title=\"\" alt=\"\" width=\"650px\" src=\"http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/btc006.jpg\"><p class=\"caption\">A man uses the Mycelium app on his phone to demonstrate how he can use BIP38 encryption to further protect his bitcoin and feel safe carrying a paper wallet with a private key exposed.<span class=\"credit\"> Photo by: Megan Miller </span></p><div class=\"desc\"><p>A man uses the Mycelium app on his phone to demonstrate how he can use BIP38 encryption to further protect his bitcoin and feel safe carrying a paper wallet with a private key exposed.</p><span class=\"credit\"> Photo by: Megan Miller </span></div></div><div class=\"slide\"><img title=\"\" alt=\"\" width=\"650px\" src=\"http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/btc007.jpg\"><p class=\"caption\">This man invests in gold, silver, bitcoin and other alternative currencies because he likes the freedom from government regulation.<span class=\"credit\"> Photo by: Megan Miller </span></p><div class=\"desc\"><p>This man invests in gold, silver, bitcoin and other alternative currencies because he likes the freedom from government regulation.</p><span class=\"credit\"> Photo by: Megan Miller </span></div></div><div class=\"slide\"><img title=\"\" alt=\"\" width=\"650px\" src=\"http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/btc008.jpg\"><p class=\"caption\">This man says that one of the safest places to store a bitcoin private key is in a \"brain wallet.\"  With a brain wallet, users remember a specific phrase that is used to generate their bitcoin information.

The currency is purely digital, and relatively few people use it. But that didn&#x2019;t stop Los Angeles photographer <a href=\"http://meganmillerimages.com/pronouns\">Megan Miller</a> from somehow bringing bitcoin to life in her photos.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The idea came to me because I really just wanted to figure out bitcoin for myself,&#x201D; Miller says.</p>\n<p>Some of the first pictures she made are exactly what you&#x2019;d expect if you know anything about <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/03/what-is-bitcoin/\">bitcoin</a>: stuff you can buy with <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/tag/bitcoin/\">bitcoin</a>. For example, Miller met a pot dealer on Craigslist who accepts the currency and photographed his stash, but not his face.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Basically at first the easiest thing to photograph was the stuff that people are purchasing with bitcoin,&#x201D; she says.  </p>\n<p>Early on she found a guy with a necklace fashioned from bitcoins made by Mike Caldwell and his <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/01/casascius-back/\">Casascius Coins</a> mint. The coins themselves aren&#x2019;t legal tender, of course; they store the private cryptography key that lets you spend or transfer your bitcoins.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Those kinds of photos are what people often associate with the currency, but I knew there was more,&#x201D; Miller says. She&#x2019;s since made portraits of bitcoin aficionados who have embraced the currency, and those working to improve bitcoin infrastructure and security.</p>\n<p>The project is by no means an encyclopedic look at bitcoin, but instead a snapshot documenting a moment in the currency&#x2019;s history.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;My real interest lies in seeing what happens,&#x201D; she says. </p>\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n</div><hr class=\"rdb-page-break\" /><div><div class=\"entry\">\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/WEDDING-IMAGE.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-660-single-full wp-image-705141\" alt=\"WEDDING-IMAGE\" src=\"http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/WEDDING-IMAGE-660x438.jpg\" width=\"660\"></a></p>\n<p><em>Spoilers for this episode of</em> Game of Thrones <em>follow, obviously</em>.</p>\n<p>Finally.</p>\n<p>This is the episode we&#x2019;ve all been waiting for, the great karmic reckoning for the countless sins of Joffrey Baratheon. Despite all the horrible things we&#x2019;ve seen on this show, it doesn&#x2019;t have as many true villains as you&#x2019;d expect. Consider Jaime, a man who once tossed a 10-year-old child off a tower because he wanted to keep having sex with his sister, who has somehow transformed into a fan-favorite hero. Or Theon, the ward who betrayed Winterfell and put its people to the sword, and yet became easily the most pitiable character in the series. People might do terrible things in <em>Game of Thrones</em> but they usually have dimensions, reasons, and tragedies of their own behind it.</p>\n<p>But Joffrey? Joffrey was always pure, irredeemable evil; the question always seemed to be not whether he would die, but when, how, and by whose hand. In the latest episode &#x201C;The Lion and the Rose,&#x201D; which was scripted by George R. R. Martin himself, we get the answer to at least one of those questions: Today was a very good day for Joffrey to die.</p>\n<p>Want to know how the episode compares to the books? We&#x2019;ve got a point-by-point breakdown:</p>\n<h2>Theon</h2>\n<p>Back at the living hell that is the Dreadfort, Ramsay Snow merrily hunts a terrified girl named Tansy through the woods with the help of his hounds&#x2014;and a female companion named Myranda (the would-be nun who seduced Theon before his castration last season) who seems just as excited about this murder game as her psychotic paramour. After Myranda shoots an arrow through the girl&#x2019;s leg, Ramsay feeds her to the dogs while a traumatized Theon (who now serves Ramsay under the name &#x201C;Reek&#x201D;) shudders.</p>\n<p>Roose Bolton returns to the Dreadfort with a new wife in tow: Walda Frey, whom he doubtless married to cement his alliance with House Frey, as Robb so fatally failed to do. He asks to see Theon and isn&#x2019;t pleased to learn that his bastard son has physically and psychologically destroyed a valuable hostage, especially while Balon Greyjoy&#x2019;s men still threaten his hold on the North. But Ramsay produces a very useful piece of information from Theon: Bran and Rickon Stark still live, and are likely heading north. Roose tells Locke (the man who cut off Jaime&#x2019;s hand) to go hunting for the Stark boys and sends Ramsay to prove himself by taking the strategically important Moat Cailin from the Ironborn with Theon.</p>\n<p>Also, is every scene with the castrated Theon going to end by cutting away to a shot of sausages from now on? I&#x2019;m not complaining, just asking.</p>\n<p><strong>In the books</strong>: Here we jump ahead to the fifth book in the series, <em>A Dance for Dragons</em>, where we encounter Theon for the first time since Ramsay&#x2019;s men captured him at Winterfell&#x2014;although he is initially introduced in the chapter only as Reek. We&#x2019;re told the torture seems to have aged him almost 40 years and whitened his hair, so TV Theon is actually looking pretty good in comparison. Ramsay indeed makes a habit of hunting girls for sport, &#x201C;rewarding&#x201D; those who give him the most amusement by raping them, killing them quickly, and naming a dog after them; those who fail to amuse him get flayed alive before death. He had no female companion like Myranda for his cruelties, however.</p>\n<p>Although Ramsay does set out to take Moat Cailin with Theon, he doesn&#x2019;t meet up with his father and his new wife Walda Frey until later. (We&#x2019;re told Roose chose the heavy-set Walda from among the Frey girls because Lord Walder Frey agreed to pay the weight of any bride in silver.) Though Roose criticizes Ramsay for some of his other&#x2026; <em>excesses</em> at that time, he doesn&#x2019;t specifically rebuke him for destroying Theon. As for Locke, who is known in the books as Vargo Hoat, he never returns to the Dreadfort; when the Mountain takes Harrenhal for the Lannisters he slowly dismembers Vargo and feeds his own flesh back to him in revenge for Jaime&#x2019;s maiming.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/brothers-lannister.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-660-single-full wp-image-705151\" alt=\"brothers-lannister\" src=\"http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/brothers-lannister-660x454.jpg\" width=\"660\"></a></p>\n<h2>The Brothers Lannister</h2>\n<p>Jaime continues to struggle with the loss of his hand, spilling wine as he eats with Tyrion. And his problems are bigger than just holding goblets: he doesn&#x2019;t know how to fight with his left hand, and it&#x2019;s only a matter of time before people realize he&#x2019;s helpless. Tyrion empathizes; he&#x2019;s a maimed dwarf with a lifetime of experience in being mocked, despised and pitied, after all. He advises Jaime to do what he has done: forget about physical prowess and focus on other skills instead, like commanding. Though different in delivery, it&#x2019;s similar advice in content to the advice Tywin gave his son, and Jaime is similarly unmoved. Since he&#x2019;s afraid of being discovered if he tries to retrain his left hand, Tyrion recommends a discreet swordsman to kick his ass in private: Bronn.</p>\n<p>Tyrion also presents a wedding gift to his terrible nephew, a venerated book called <em>The Lives of Four Kings</em>. Though he pretends to accept it graciously, that&#x2019;s obviously a fakeout; he soon chops it into pieces with the gift he gets from Tywin, the other Valyrian sword forged from Ned&#x2019;s broadsword, which he names Widow&#x2019;s Wail. Varys also informs Tyrion that thanks to Shae&#x2019;s tantrum last week, word about her has gotten back to Cersei, and he can&#x2019;t (or won&#x2019;t) lie about it if she asks. Sure enough, Cersei points Shae out to Lord Tywin&#x2014;who promised to hang Tyrion&#x2019;s next prostitute&#x2014;and he orders her brought to the Tower of the Hand before the wedding. Since Shae refuses to acknowledge the danger, Tyrion finally chooses the nuclear option and ends things ugly: he tells her she&#x2019;s just a unworthy whore to him, and has Bronn drag her off to a ship bound for Pentos while she cries. There&#x2019;s a scene in the first book where Arya has to send away her direwolf, Nymeria, so that the Lannisters won&#x2019;t kill her for biting Joffrey; she throws rocks at her until she finally leaves, because it&#x2019;s the only way to save her. It feels a lot like this. Peter Dinklage is amazing here, spitting out every horrible word like a punch to his own gut.</p>\n<p><strong>In the books</strong>: Instead of Bronn, Jaime practiced left-handed swordfighting with childhood friend Ser Addam Marbrand&#x2014;and later, Ser Ilyn Payne, whose tongue was removed by the Mad King and thus can tell no tales of Jaime&#x2019;s failings. Although Varys warns Tyrion that he won&#x2019;t lie about Shae if asked, we see no indication that Cersei has discovered her. Indeed, in the previous book <em>A Clash for Kings</em> Cersei tried to learn the identity of Tyrion&#x2019;s prostitute and mistakenly believed it to be another woman, Alayaya. Though Tyrion worries for Shae and ultimately decides to marry her off to a knight named Ser Tallad to keep her safe, he never rejects her and she knows nothing about his plans before the wedding.</p>\n<h2>Dragonstone</h2>\n<p>As Melisandre continues her conversion of Dragonstone to the Red God, it&#x2019;s time for some good old-fashioned burnings at the stake. Three men go to the flames for refusing to accept the Lord of Light, including Lady Selyse&#x2019;s brother&#x2014;and thanks to her R&#x2019;hllor fanaticism she is <em>super psyched</em> about it. There&#x2019;s an awkward dinner afterwards involving Melisandre, Stannis and Selyse where Selyse tries to recall fond memories with her husband and he shuts her the hell down in front of his mistress. Selyse talks about how their &#x201C;sinful&#x201D; daughter Shireen needs to be beaten, which Stannis shuts down even harder. They send Melisandre to proselytize to the princess instead, wherein the Red Lady tries to compare the screams of the burned men to the screams of women giving birth, whom afterwards are filled with joy. &#x201C;Afterwards they aren&#x2019;t ash and bone,&#x201D; responds the girl. Point: Shireen. Melisandre says the seven gods of the septons are a lie and there are only two gods: a lord of light and a lord of darkness who are eternally at war. Sounds an awful lot like Christianity, no? Especially when you factor in the Inquisition-like burnings. And even more so when she explains the truth about hell: &#x201C;There is only one hell, princess. The one we live in now.&#x201D;</p>\n<p><strong>In the books</strong>: Although Selyse and Melisandre burn a number of people, including Selyse&#x2019;s brother, it doesn&#x2019;t happen quite like this. After Melisandre burns down the sept (the church of the Faith of the Seven) on Dragonstone, a lord named Guncer Glass withdraws his support for Stannis and is burned by Selyse while Stannis is fighting the Battle of the Blackwater. Selyse&#x2019;s brother Alester Florent serves as the Hand for Stannis and uses his position to try and make peace with the Lannisters; he is imprisoned and later burned for it. We never see Melisandre and Shireen speak, perhaps in part because neither have their own chapters in <em>Storm of Swords</em>.</p>\n<h2>Bran</h2>\n<p>A hungry Bran goes skinshifting into his direwolf Summer and feeds on a deer, until Jojen and Meera wake him. They say he&#x2019;s been gone for hours and while they understand it&#x2019;s awesome to be able to run as a wolf, if he stays too long in Summer he&#x2019;ll forget his humanity and never return. They encounter a strange tree with a face in it, and when he touches it he sees a series of images: a three-eyed crow, his father, the Iron Throne room covered in falling snow, the face of a White Walker reflected in ice, himself falling from the tower at Winterfell, and most ominously, what appears to be the shadow of a dragon over Kings Landing. A voice says &#x201C;north,&#x201D; but then after Bran awakens and says &#x201C;I know where we have to go.&#x201D;</p>\n<p><strong>In the books</strong>: We seem to be jumping ahead to <em>A Dance with Dragons</em> here as well, skipping at least some of Bran&#x2019;s journey north of the Wall. He does feed from behind the eyes of his wolf when hungry, though on the flesh of dead Night&#x2019;s Watch men rather than animals. Instead of touching a tree, Bran eats a weirwood paste that inspires a series of visions through the heart tree of Winterfell. All those visions seem to take place throughout the history of Winterfell, however, rather all of Westeros; there is no image of a dragon or Kings Landing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/wedding2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-660-single-full wp-image-705161\" alt=\"wedding2\" src=\"http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/wedding2-660x439.jpg\" width=\"660\"></a></p>\n<h2>The Purple Wedding</h2>\n<p>After a sumptuous wedding attended by all the usual suspects (including Elliara Sand, whose dress has <em>amazing</em> shoulderpads that look like the &#x2019;80s by way of Mars), Tywin complains about the expense to Lady Olenna. It&#x2019;s a scene that&#x2019;s basically an excuse for them to banter some more, which I approve of since they have somehow become the OTP [<em>Ed.</em>&#x2014;One True Pairing] of this show for me. Olenna also straight-up tells Mace Tyrell to shoo because the grownups are talking, emphasizing yet again who the true power behind the Tyrells is. She also pauses briefly to admire Sansa, with her pretty hair and pretty necklace, and offers condolences for the Red Wedding.</p>\n<p>After Margaery announces that they&#x2019;re donating the leftovers from the feast to the poor, Cersei orders Pycelle to have the food fed to the dogs instead because she is no longer queen and feeling rather petty about it. The Red Viper helpfully shows up to needle the former Queen Regent about her fading power, bring up his sister&#x2019;s murder for the millionth time, and suggests that her daughter Myrcella is lucky to be in Dorne where they are less fond of killing of children. <em>Ooooh.</em> The Viper and his lady also make eyes at Loras, possibly foreshadowing a future threesome; that causes the knight to stumble into Jaime, who casually informs him that if he marries Cersei she&#x2019;ll kill him in his sleep. It&#x2019;s a dangerous wedding feast, and it&#x2019;s just getting started.</p>\n<p>Brienne offers her congratulations to the royal couple, and is greeted graciously by her once-and-current queen Margaery, and indifferently by Joffrey. As she leaves, Cersei thanks her for saving Jaime, and the too-honest Brienne unwisely says that Jaime saved her as well. That&#x2019;s a story about Jaime that Cersei hasn&#x2019;t heard, and Cersei doesn&#x2019;t like women with stories about Jaime that she hasn&#x2019;t heard. Not to mention a woman like Brienne, who has all the physical prowess and power that Cersei always felt denied because of her gender. Her voice gets dangerous and she asks whether Brienne loves Jaime, which Brienne effectively answers with a dust cloud.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_711871\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/photo-16.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/photo-16-293x300.jpg\" alt=\"Ladies and maesters, your weekly emoji recap of this episode.\" width=\"293\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-711871\"></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ladies and maesters, your weekly emoji recap of this episode.</figcaption></div>Since it wouldn&#x2019;t be Joffrey&#x2019;s wedding if things didn&#x2019;t get terrible, he soon summons a troupe of little people for a comical reenactment of the War of Five Kings that is clearly designed to humiliate Tyrion. It also functions as a quick summary of all the worst things that have happened in <em>Game of Thrones</em> so far, and thus manages to upset several other people as well, particularly Loras and Sansa when it mocks the deaths of Renly and Robb. As Sansa and Tyrion sit at the lonely end of the table like Team I Hate My Life, Joffrey invites Tyrion to join the other dwarves, which Tyrion declines with an incredibly unwise shot at Joffrey&#x2019;s masculinity. Joffrey empties his goblet of wine over Tyrion&#x2019;s head in response, and orders Tyrion to serve as his cupbearer, throwing his cup and demanding that Tyrion kneel. Margaery manages to distract him by announcing that the pie has arrived.\n<p>He cuts the pie with his new sword and Margaery coos that he&#x2019;s her hero; you get the feeling that the rest of her life is going to be a long series of attempts to divert his sadism with some version of &#x201C;look, the pie!&#x201D; Although Tyrion tries to slip away with Sansa, Joffrey soon calls him back demanding more wine to wash it down. After he drinks, he starts coughing and suddenly he&#x2019;s choking. Jaime and Cersei run to his side, but there&#x2019;s nothing to be done. The Monster of Kings Landing dies, fast and ugly, in the arms of both of his real parents, one finger extended to point at Tyrion&#x2014;who happens to be holding the poisoned goblet that killed him. Cersei screams for the guards to arrest Tyrion for the murder of the King, and boy is he screwed.</p>\n<p><strong>In the books</strong>: The wedding and feast are very similar to the books, though Jaime doesn&#x2019;t return to King&#x2019;s Landing with Brienne until after the wedding, so neither of them are present. A few other details are different: The wedding chalice that Mace Tyrell gives Joffrey is actually three feet tall and not much smaller than Tyrion himself. Margaery never plans to donate the feed to the poor, and Joffrey doesn&#x2019;t throw coins at any bards, though we&#x2019;re told that &#x201C;The Rains of Castamere&#x201D; is performed numerous times. There&#x2019;s also no banter between Tywin and Olemma, and instead of Joffrey, the pie is cut by Ned-beheader Ilyn Payne. Rather than the larger performance of the War of Five Kings, there are only two dwarf jousters, representing the Starks and the Baratheons, who enter riding a pig and a dog.

If you really want to understand the death of Joffrey Baratheon&#x2014;who killed him, how, and why&#x2014;you have to understand the history of violence that preceded it.</p>\n<p>As monstrous as he was, Joffrey didn&#x2019;t happen in a vacuum. Rather, he was a link in a much larger chain of anger and blood that stretched back long before the War of Five Kings to Robert&#x2019;s Rebellion, and earlier still.</p>\n<p>Much like the War of Five Kings, the Rebellion started with a king who made a fatal error involving the Starks. After Ned&#x2019;s sister Lyanna was taken by the Targaryen heir Rhaegar, his father and brother sought justice from King Aerys II&#x2014;but were brutally executed by him instead. That forced Ned and Robert (who was betrothed to Lyanna) to go to war, leading to the fall of the Targaryens, the exodus of Daenerys, and the deaths not only of Rhaegar, but his wife Elia and two children, at the hands of Lannister soldiers. The rebellion put Robert on the throne, and with Lyanna dead it put Cersei on the throne beside him&#x2014;and Joffrey after him.</p>\n<p>Each act of violence was provoked by violence, and each provoked more violence still. A generation later, the consequences of Robert&#x2019;s Rebellion still directly inform everything that happens, not only in obvious forms like the vengeful Red Viper, but more subtle ones like Cersei. The great schism of her marriage to Robert was not just her secret relationship with Jaime but his inability to forget Lyanna&#x2014;the feeling of living powerlessly in the shadow of a dead woman. While this might seem like a less dangerous consequence of Robert&#x2019;s Rebellion than a vicious warrior like Oberyn Martell coming to claim vengeance, Cersei&#x2019;s jealousy and frustration becomes a far more destructive force for the Seven Kingdoms.</p>\n<p>Resentment has always been the defining emotion of Cersei&#x2019;s life. She believes that she was unjustly denied the love, power and respect she believes she deserved&#x2014;not just because of Lyanna, but because she was born a woman. She&#x2019;s always seen her twin, Jaime, as the alternate universe version of herself, the person she might have been if she had been born a man. While she got traded like chattel to someone she didn&#x2019;t love, Jaime became a hero of tournaments and battlefields, powerful and feared.</p>\n<p>And she has a point. It sucks that she got undermined and deprived of opportunities at every turn in ways that Jaime wasn&#x2019;t. But let&#x2019;s also be real: If Cersei really had been a man, she might&#x2019;ve been a ruthless fighter, but she also would have been a <em>terrible</em> leader in every possible way. We see it in her total mismanagement as Queen Regent, and we see it even more clearly in Joffrey. Just like so much of the violence we see in the Seven Kingdoms, Cersei decides to take all her frustration and pain and pay it forward. And since she&#x2019;s not a warrior, she does it the only way she knows how: by teaching her son to be all of the things she couldn&#x2019;t be.</p>\n<p>Cersei has always been a broken hammer that saw everyone around her as a nail, and she resents the fact that she didn&#x2019;t get to spend her life pounding them down. And so she raises a son who sees it as his god-given right to do exactly that. Where she felt her will subordinated at every turn by men, she teaches Joffrey to see his will done at every turn, no matter what the consequences.</p>\n<p>This is the great irony of Cersei: that while she spent her life chafing under the limitations of a sexist culture, rather than shaping Joffrey into the type of man who might grant a woman power, she turns him into a man who delights in abusing women. She sees herself in him, rather than the women he tortures, the way she has always seen herself in Jaime&#x2014;because they are the ones with the power.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Someday you&#x2019;ll sit the throne and the truth will be what you make it,&#x201D; Cersei tells her son after he is bested by Arya and bitten by her wolf, insisting that in the story everyone else hears, Joffrey will be the hero. &#x201C;You are my darling boy, and the world will be exactly as you want it to be.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>In the books, Tywin describes Joffrey as Robert the Second after a particularly frustrating interaction with the young king, but Tyrion calls him something worse: Aerys the Third, a spiritual successor not to his inept &#x201C;father&#x201D; but to the Mad King whose cruelty inspired Robert&#x2019;s Rebellion and ended the Targaryen dynasty after more than a thousand years. It&#x2019;s an apt comparison.</p>\n<p>Joffrey sees power the way Cersei taught him to see it: like a gun that never stops firing, a zero-sum game you lose the moment you fail to show force. It&#x2019;s the same thing Cersei said to Littlefinger long ago when she had a soldier hold a knife to his throat: &#x201C;Power is power.&#x201D; And it is, until it isn&#x2019;t. Joffrey&#x2019;s sense of entitlement is so complete that any impediments to his will, no matter how small, seem like an intolerable injustice that must be greeted with instant, blinding violence. The beheading of Ned Stark was as devastating as it was pointless, an impetuous cruelty that nearly cost him his crown. But this has always been the fatal flaw of Joffrey: not simply that he is evil and cruel, but that he is evil and cruel to the wrong people, and without regard for the consequences.</p>\n<p>Indeed, a great many of Joffrey&#x2019;s horrific acts might have gone unpunished if only he&#x2019;d learned how to indulge them more carefully. That&#x2019;s the difference too between Roose Bolton, a man who flayed his enemies but still managed to ally with the nobler-than-thou Starks, and his bastard Ramsay, who places no strategic limits on his sadism. That&#x2019;s why Roose criticizes Ramsay&#x2014;not for his crimes but for his lack of context or subtlety, and what that failing could cost them.</p>\n<p>Here&#x2019;s the final irony of Cersei: She killed her son. Regardless of who poisoned the wine, she&#x2019;s a huge part of what made them slip it in the cup. If she&#x2019;d raised him to be a different kind of king&#x2014;or at least, more careful about his worst impulses&#x2014;he might very well have lived through his wedding. Instead, she turned him into an obvious, ugly liability, making his death attractive not only to his enemies but many of his &#x201C;allies&#x201D; as well. Who had the motivation to kill Joffrey? Pretty much everyone, including anyone who didn&#x2019;t want the Lannisters&#x2019; hold on the crown to end the same way it did for the Targaryens.</p>\n<p>In the books, Arya says that when she learns about Joffrey&#x2019;s death she feels nothing. She might have named him every night on her death list, but now that she&#x2019;s finally able to cross him off she realizes that it doesn&#x2019;t bring back Ned, or Catelyn, or Robb. She&#x2019;s busy committing murders of her own right now as well, an arc of violence set entirely in motion by Joffrey&#x2019;s own acts of cruelty. His death now can do nothing to stop it, or her, as she wanders the Riverlands with the Hound, both of them paying the pain forward over and over&#x2014;like Robert, like Cersei, like Joffrey&#x2014;whether they know it or not.</p>\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n</div><hr class=\"rdb-page-break\" /><div><div class=\"entry\">\n\t\t\t<div id=\"attachment_711111\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/140409_roku_streaming_01.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/140409_roku_streaming_01-660x440.jpg\" alt=\"Roku streaming stick.

It has the brains of a puck, and most of the brawn. It also has a few unique tricks of its own. But because it&#x2019;s a stick, it&#x2019;s cheaper and simpler, and therefore a great option for people new to the whole puck-and-stick streaming game.</p>\n<p>The stick in question is the new <a href=\"http://www.roku.com/products/streaming-stick\">Roku Streaming Stick</a>, a simple $50 device that&#x2019;s roughly double the size of a USB thumb drive. It plugs into the HDMI port on your television (any HDMI port &#x2014; it doesn&#x2019;t require an MHL port like last year&#x2019;s version did) and it gives you all of the core functionality of the larger, more expensive <a href=\"http://www.roku.com/products/roku-3\">$100 Roku set-top box</a>. It has nearly everything a modern cable-cutter desires: it&#x2019;ll do Netflix, you can watch Amazon Instant Video, you can use it to run Plex. In short, you have access to all of the same content that you&#x2019;d get with any other Roku device, and at the same quality; up to 1080p.</p>\n<p>There are a few trade-offs. Most notably, the remote on the Streaming Stick isn&#x2019;t as advanced as the ones that come with Roku&#x2019;s fancier set-top boxes. It&#x2019;s an RF remote, so you don&#x2019;t have to point it at the device to control it, which is nice since the device is hidden behind your TV. But you don&#x2019;t get the headphone jack &#x2014; the Roku 2 and 3 come with a remote that allows you to plug in a set of headphones and watch TV while listening privately, so you can avoid distracting or disturbing the others in your household as you binge on <em>Weeds</em>. It&#x2019;s a great feature, and one of the coolest parts of the Roku puck experience. The Streaming Stick doesn&#x2019;t offer this nicety. Also, there&#x2019;s no motion sensor in the remote like there is in the Roku 3, so you can&#x2019;t use the Streaming Stick to play <em>Angry Birds</em>. This doesn&#x2019;t matter nearly as much &#x2014; while I know many people who love being able to watch TV with their headphones late at night and not wake their spouse, I don&#x2019;t know anyone who uses their set-top box to play games.</p>\n<p>When I first took delivery of Roku&#x2019;s stick, I had low expectations. It&#x2019;s very small, and I figured there was no way it could stand on equal ground with the power-packed Roku 3. I&#x2019;ve owned several Rokus, and the company&#x2019;s earlier, cheaper boxes were anemic. On my first Roku, the Wi-Fi reception wasn&#x2019;t great, so HD streams would often buffer or get stuck or just crash. The early boxes also didn&#x2019;t have the processing power to handle 1080p videos without stutters or hiccups. I guessed the stick would show the same weaknesses of Roku&#x2019;s lesser hardware. After all, it&#x2019;s just so impossibly small.</p>\n<p>But running Netflix, Plex, and Vimeo &#x2014; all at the highest quality &#x2014; never presented any major issues. It was a bit slow to load Netflix, taking 20 or 30 seconds, but once the app was running, the stick didn&#x2019;t stutter. You&#x2019;re reliant on Wi-Fi, since unlike the larger puck, there is no RJ-45 jack to plug a network cable into when things get choppy. But the stick&#x2019;s dual-band N capability proved entirely adequate during my week of testing.</p>\n<p>I was also curious about how it was powered when I first saw it, since HDMI ports don&#x2019;t transmit voltage, and the stick lacks a traditional power supply. Turns out, there&#x2019;s a tiny micro USB port on the tip of the stick. You have to run a cable (included) from the end of the stick to your TV&#x2019;s USB port to give it the juice to operate. If you don&#x2019;t have a USB port, or if the quality of the stick is sucking, you can plug the USB cable into a wall-socket adapter (also included). It takes away some of the magic (&#x201C;Wow, it&#x2019;s just a tiny stick!&#x201D;), but it gets the job done.</p>\n<p>A bit more about that remote. It comes with dedicated buttons for some popular services. I&#x2019;m actually not a fan of this. Sure, there&#x2019;s a Netflix button and an Amazon button. I&#x2019;ll use those. But also one for Blockbuster, which I&#x2019;ve never used and probably never will. There&#x2019;s also a dedicated button for <a href=\"http://www.mgo.com/\">MGO</a>, which I just learned existed (it&#x2019;s a movie service) and will also never use. I&#x2019;d much rather have a remote with programmable buttons, or a simpler remote with fewer buttons.</p>\n<p>You don&#x2019;t have to use the remote if you don&#x2019;t want to. You can use your phone or tablet by just downloading the Roku app. Once you do that, you can tap your touchscreen to change channels, perform searches, and browse for things to watch. You can also throw videos from your mobile to the Streaming Stick, letting you watch something on the big screen instead of the small one. It&#x2019;s here where the Roku Streaming Stick most clearly butts up against Google&#x2019;s own stick, the <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2013/07/one-night-with-chromecast/\">Chromecast</a>. Both devices let you &#x201C;cast&#x201D; videos up onto the television, but it&#x2019;s much easier with the Chromecast. The Roku can only throw videos from the YouTube and Netflix apps on your Android or iOS phone, though the company says support for more apps is coming soon. I had trouble getting HD videos from YouTube to cast properly, and the Netflix app crashed often enough that I just picked up the remote and went straight through Roku&#x2019;s menus to watch the video I wanted.</p>\n<p>Still, casting isn&#x2019;t why you want to buy one of these. You want one because it&#x2019;s a cheap way into the Roku platform for streaming video. The company still offers the best ecosystem, giving you a dizzying array of programming options. There&#x2019;s a way to watch just about anything you can think of on Roku, either through one of the subscription streaming services like Netflix or Hulu, one of the free app-based content portals like PBS or Vimeo, or one of the media server apps like Plex. What you can&#x2019;t watch is stuff you buy on iTunes, since it&#x2019;s protected with DRM and will only play properly on an Apple TV or some other trusted, Apple-sanctioned environment. But everything else is fair game.</p>\n<p>If you&#x2019;re going to buy just one device, I would still recommend <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2013/04/roku-3-2/\">the Roku 3</a>. It has the best hardware features, and it has the private audio option. But if you have an Apple TV and you just want some additional programming choices, or if you want to experiment in puckland but you don&#x2019;t want to spend the $100 to buy in at the top tier, the Streaming Stick makes a great entry-level choice.</p>\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n</div><hr class=\"rdb-page-break\" /><div><div class=\"entry\">\n\t\t\t\n\n<div><div class=\"slide\"><img title=\"\" alt=\"\" width=\"650px\" src=\"http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/belvita-01.jpg\"><p class=\"caption\"><span class=\"credit\"> Photos by FakeLove </span></p></div><div class=\"slide\"><img title=\"\" alt=\"\" width=\"650px\" src=\"http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/belvita-02.jpg\"><p class=\"caption\"><span class=\"credit\"> Photos by FakeLove </span></p></div><div class=\"slide\"><img title=\"\" alt=\"\" width=\"650px\" src=\"http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/belvita-07.jpg\"><p class=\"caption\"><span class=\"credit\"> Photos by FakeLove </span></p></div><div class=\"slide\"><img title=\"\" alt=\"\" width=\"650px\" src=\"http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/belvita-03.jpg\"><p class=\"caption\"><span class=\"credit\"> Photos by FakeLove </span></p></div><div class=\"slide\"><img title=\"\" alt=\"\" width=\"650px\" src=\"http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/belvita-06.jpg\"><p class=\"caption\"><span class=\"credit\"> Photos by FakeLove </span></p></div><div class=\"slide\"><img title=\"\" alt=\"\" width=\"650px\" src=\"http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/belvita-08.jpg\"><p class=\"caption\"><span class=\"credit\"> Photos by FakeLove </span></p></div><div class=\"slide\"><img title=\"\" alt=\"\" width=\"650px\" src=\"http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/belvita-04.jpg\"><p class=\"caption\"><span class=\"credit\"> Photos by FakeLove </span></p></div><div class=\"slide\"><img title=\"\" alt=\"\" width=\"650px\" src=\"http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/belvita-05.jpg\"><p class=\"caption\"><span class=\"credit\"> Photos by FakeLove </span></p></div></div><p>When was the last time you talked about your favorite cracker on Twitter? It&#x2019;s a dry subject and the marketing team responsible for promoting Nabisco&#x2019;s new <a href=\"http://www.belvitabreakfast.com/\">Belvita</a> brand crackers knew that their key selling point, &#x201C;Nutritious sustained energy all morning,&#x201D; wasn&#x2019;t going to light the social web on fire without a little help. Instead of following their traditional strategy of minting coupons or, God forbid, coming up with a strategy involving QR codes, Belvita decided to embrace 3-D printing in a crassly commercial, and wildly successful, ad campaign.</p>\n<p>Creative agencies <a href=\"http://droga5.com/\">Droga5</a> and <a href=\"http://fakelove.tv/\">Fake Love</a> took on the challenge of making this vision a reality by turning to Twitter and encouraging people to share their greatest morning accomplishments&#x2014;say nailing the perfect pour-over or starting their commute just as a fist-pumping anthem came on the radio. Cracker enthusiasts the world over started responding with their stories, encouraged by celebrities like Jane Lynch and Mario Lopez, using the hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23morningwin&amp;src=typd\">#MorningWin</a>.</p>\n<p>The agencies hired actors, complete with props ranging from spatulas to rubber chickens, to act out the best scenarios. Each tableau was scanned, 3-D printed, spray painted gold, affixed to a trophy, and mailed to the person who inspired it. Virtual trophies were awarded on Facebook and people were delighted to receive validation of their life&#x2019;s minutiae in miniature plastic form.</p>\n\n<p class=\"pullquote-left\">Each tableau was 3-D printed, affixed to a trophy, and mailed to the person who inspired it.</p>\n<p>Belvita&#x2019;s brand managers imagined the printing happening on a sterile soundstage and shooting footage for a commercial, but the creatives at Fake Love had an idea that would expand the campaign&#x2019;s reach into the real world. They rented a store front in New York City and set up a shop that was equal parts art gallery and bakery. Inside the store, visitors could observe actors clad in fluorescent green unitards pantomime tweets from followers across the globe. Passersby could watch a bank of printers transform the outlandish ideas into objects in the store&#x2019;s window. </p>\n<p>This exhibitionist streak created some unique challenges. Building a life-sized 3-D scanner and writing the software from scratch took some know-how. Using low-cost 3-D printers mean the parts had to be printed in a single piece and some floating objects needed to have artful enhancements made using a digital sculpting tool called ZBrush to ensure the trophies were robust enough to ship. </p>\n<p>Crowdsourcing the concepts was a major driver of the project&#x2019;s difficulty, and fun. One tweeter enjoyed a win with three friends forcing three bodysuit-clad models to bunch up in the makeshift scanner. &#x201C;Luckily, Twitter&#x2019;s 140-character limit prevented the tweets from getting too crazy,&#x201D; says Josh Horowitz, the founder and creative director of Fake Love. </p>\n<p>Even the weather added to the challenge. The building&#x2019;s large glass window made it susceptible to wide temperature fluctuations as snow storms battered the city. Turning the heat up made print jobs run smoother, if a little less comfortable for the Lycra-clad laborers. </p>\n<p>Most creatives that use 3-D printers treat the output as an intermediate stage, say crafting a model of a character or prototype of a new product, but the Fake Love crew treated them as production tools and actually mailed the output to their sources of inspiration.</p>\n<p>These tchotchkes may lack the polish of an Academy Award or Grammy, but aren&#x2019;t far off quality-wise from the toys packed in breakfast cereal boxes. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s really valuable for us, for everything we do; it&#x2019;s experimental and it&#x2019;s tactile,&#x201D; says Horowitz. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re able to print custom objects that we wouldn&#x2019;t be able buy off the shelf.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>3-D printers have the promise to change the world. They can be used to improve, and even save, the lives of children. Ultimately, they&#x2019;ll force us to rethink everything from how we build cars to practice medicine. But after the success of the Belvita campaign, which generated 80 million social impressions on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram and contributed to a 100 percent sales bump, don&#x2019;t be surprised to see 3-D printers used to sell more gewgaws and gadgets.</p>\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n</div><hr class=\"rdb-page-break\" /><div><div class=\"entry\">\n\t\t\t\n<div class=\"gallery-wrap lazy-load-off\">\n\t<div class=\"wp35-gallery regular\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t   \n\n\t\t\n\t\t</div> \n\t</div>\n<div><div class=\"slide\"><img title=\"\" alt=\"\" width=\"650px\" src=\"http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/140409_windows_phone_8.1_01.jpg\"><p class=\"caption\">Live Tiles are one of the best things about Windows Phone.

Now, you can fit more of them on your homescreen. Microsoft added three column support to some Windows Phone 8.1 handsets. You can also choose a photo as your home screen Live Tile background, which makes for a nice visual effect. The photo stays stationary, but as you flick upwards to get to more tiles, they scroll upwards and act as a window looking onto this photo. You can also customize the lock screen more with different themes. But because this is something developers will have to upload and make available, I didn't get to test the feature out. Also, if you dismiss a notification for an app, the Live Tile gets updated to reflect that. </p><span class=\"credit\"> Photos by Josh Valcarcel/WIRED </span></div></div><div class=\"slide\"><img title=\"\" alt=\"\" width=\"650px\" src=\"http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/140409_windows_phone_8.1_02.jpg\"><p class=\"caption\">Cortana, Microsoft's digital assistant, has personality and smarts thanks to deep Bing integration.<span class=\"credit\"> Photos by Josh Valcarcel/WIRED </span></p><div class=\"desc\"><div><h3>Cortana</h3>The most anticipated (and most talked about) feature in Windows Phone 8.1 is without a doubt Cortana, Microsoft's new virtual assistant. Cortana manifests herself as an app that you can pin as a Live Tile to the home screen. When you speak to her, or she's processing a query, Cortana's graphic of concentric circles (colored to match the theme you picked on your handset) expands and contracts until she pulls up the results. To access Windows Phone's assistant, you just tap the Live Tile, then tap the speaker button to voice a query or type out a question. \n\nWhen you first open Cortana, you can begin teaching her some of your interests. I told her I was interested in technology, science, and news, gave her my name, and gave her permission to read through my emails. I also synced up access to Facebook. But this is a lot of trust for a first date with a personal assistant. Microsoft is sensitive to the fact that you may not want to give Cortana access to your whole digital life up front. As such, it gives you granular controls over your interests, as well as what personal data she has access to. You can also switch her off altogether in the app's settings.\n\nOpen up Cortana and you'll see a short list of top headlines for the interests you have selected. But as you use her more, she starts bringing up more data that's relevant to you, like the weather in your location, or travel times to and from work. Cortana was able to successfully identify where my work address was and asked if I wanted it to remember that location. A day later, she identified my home address and asked if I would like her to remember that too. I thought it was smart of Microsoft for Cortana to learn the less personal of the two addresses first.\n\nLike Siri and Google Now, Cortana can perform different \"assistant-like\" activities. She can check your calendar, as well as schedule appointments and reminders while also looking for conflicts. She can pull up the weather, or find directions to a location, and you can do this using normal, conversational language, with follow up questions to get extra information. \n\nCompared to Google Now and Siri, Cortana offers far more customization and privacy controls. But Google Now still wins on providing the information you're looking for in the most easy to glean manner. For me, Siri still wins on convenience. Too often Cortana resorted to Bing search results when I felt like there could have been some sort of Card-like quick answer for my question. \n\nCortana also had trouble discerning my voice in situations where there was a significant amount of background noise, like in the car, or at a Starbucks. In the car, I tried asking if there was traffic on my route, and my question was misheard as a request to send a Facebook contact a message. \n\nCortana is in <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2013/04/beta/\">beta</a> though, so hopefully she'll get better at her job over time. </div><span class=\"credit\"> Photos by Josh Valcarcel/WIRED </span></div></div><div class=\"slide\"><img title=\"\" alt=\"\" width=\"650px\" src=\"http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/140409_windows_phone_8.1_03.jpg\"><p class=\"caption\">Windows 8.1 brings with it Internet Explorer 11 with HTML 5 video support.<span class=\"credit\"> Photos by Josh Valcarcel/WIRED </span></p><div class=\"desc\"><p><h3>IE 11</h3>Internet Explorer is still the butt of many a browser joke.

The 8.1 update is no exception. This latest upgrade brings convenience and productivity features that finally make the mobile OS competitive with its older, more experienced rivals, iOS and Android. Considering it&#x2019;s been <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2010/10/windows-phone-7-3/\">over three and a half years</a> since Microsoft&#x2019;s serious push into the smartphone space with Windows Phone 7, it&#x2019;s about time. </p>\n<p>But it would be a disservice to imply that the new features in Windows Phone 8.1 are merely &#x201C;me too&#x201D; additions. As the mobile OS has evolved, it&#x2019;s continued to develop a personality of its own. A drastically different UI and home screen, as well as a true focus on personalization, means Windows Phone 8.1 does a lot of things, and does them with a unique flair all its own. </p>\n<p>We&#x2019;ve been playing around with a Nokia Lumia Icon loaded up with the developer preview of Windows Phone 8.1 for the past few weeks. Rather than review pre-release software, which will continue to change over the next few weeks, we&#x2019;ve decided to highlight some of 8.1&#x2032;s more notable features and explain how they work.</p>\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n</div><hr class=\"rdb-page-break\" /><div><div class=\"entry\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img alt=\"Sunmoonplanetrise pho 2013216 Nyberg jpg jpg  720&#xD7;480 \" src=\"http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/sunmoonplanetrise_pho_2013216_nyberg_jpg_jpg_720x480_.jpg\" width=\"660\"><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">A view of the sunrise (and moon) as seen from the ISS captured by astronaut Karen Nyberg. <em>Image: NASA</em></figcaption></div>\n<p>There was a recent news item about <a href=\"http://www.avclub.com/article/star-treks-kate-mulgrew-says-she-was-tricked-narra-203216\">Star Trek&#x2019;s Kate Mulgrew in a geocentric movie</a>. The geocentric model states that the Sun and the planets move around the Earth instead of the heliocentric model with the Sun in the center. That&#x2019;s just silly, right? Obviously the Earth orbits the Sun.</p>\n<p>Sure, the textbooks all say that the solar system is heliocentric. But how do we know that? More importantly, how can YOU tell which is the better model?</p>\n<h2>A Case for the Geocentric Model</h2>\n<p>The geocentric model is no more crazy than saying that a tennis ball is made of protons, neutrons and electrons. Sure, we all (most of us) believe there are these particles like electrons &#x2013; but how do normal humans know this? In fact, the evidence in our everyday lives doesn&#x2019;t make it obvious that there are protons and electrons (yes, you could argue the mere fact of things like computers says these have to exist). The same is true for the heliocentric model.</p>\n<p>Find a human that has never looked at a science book and doesn&#x2019;t know anything about the solar system. Now ask this human if the Earth moves around the Sun or the Sun moves around the Earth. I would bet most of these isolated humans would pick the geocentric model. It just doesn&#x2019;t feel like the Earth is moving.</p>\n<p>There is another very convincing argument for the geocentric model &#x2013; stellar parallax (or lack of). What is parallax? Parallax is the apparent change in position of objects due to a change in observation location. You might have noticed this with the <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2013/09/parallax-and-the-ios-7-wallpaper/\">iOS background motion</a>. &#xA0;You can also easily see an example of parallax by holding your thumb out in front of your face. &#xA0;Using just your left eye look at where the thumb lines up with some object in the distant background. &#xA0;Now look with just your right eye &#x2013; the thumb moved, right? &#xA0;That&#x2019;s parallax since your two eyes are at different locations.</p>\n<p>The ancient Greeks claimed that if the Earth is moving around the Sun then the stars should shift their positions due to this orbital motion (called stellar parallax). Guess what? The stars don&#x2019;t shift. Well, they don&#x2019;t shift enough for you to notice, but they do indeed shift. This is essentially the same reason <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2010/09/why-does-the-moon-follow-me/\">the moon appears to follow you around when you drive</a>&#xA0;- it&#x2019;s too far away for any apparent shift due to your motion.</p>\n<h2>Historical Development of the Heliocentric Model</h2>\n<p>For me, the sequence of events that brought most humans to a heliocentric model is just a great story. It&#x2019;s a great example of the scientific process. Humans make a model and then change the model after collecting more data. This brings in many useful concepts that are covered in an introductory astronomy course.</p>\n<p>The first big problem with the geocentric model was the retrograde motion of planets like Mars. If you looked at the location of Mars each night, it might sometimes do this.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img alt=\"Mars Retrograde   Mars Exploration Program\" src=\"http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/mars_retrograde_mars_exploration_program.jpg\" width=\"584\"><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Image: NASA/JPL-Caltech</em></figcaption></div>\n<p>How does the geocentric model deal with this new evidence? Here are some of the highlights.</p>\n<blockquote><p>* Ptolemy develops a geocentric model that has the planets moving around the Earth. However, in order to account for retrograde motion, he put the planets on circles that move in circles.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>* Copernicus suggests a heliocentric model. His model has the planets moving around the Sun in circular orbits. This can explain retrograde motion, but his model doesn&#x2019;t fit all the planetary position data that well. Really, it&#x2019;s no better than Ptolemy&#x2019;s geocentric model.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>* Kepler proposes that the planets do not orbit in circles. Instead, they have elliptical orbits. This agrees with the observational data very well.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>*Galileo gets a telescope and looks at the sky. He see stuff that suggests the Earth orbits the Sun. I&#x2019;ll discuss these in a bit.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>* Newton develops a model for gravity that also says planets would have elliptical orbits.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This change from geocentric to heliocentric took a long time. It&#x2019;s silly to think that people just woke up one day and said &#x201C;Ah ha! Let&#x2019;s put the Sun in the center!&#x201D;</p>\n<h2>How Can You Tell the Earth Orbits the Sun?</h2>\n<p>No one likes to just trust the textbook. You don&#x2019;t have to. Here are some things you can do to determine for yourself what orbits what.</p>\n<p><strong>Phases of Venus.</strong> The next time Venus is visible in the sky, take a look at it with some binoculars. It will probably look something like this.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img alt=\"I Photo\" src=\"http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/i_photo2.jpg\" width=\"650\"><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Image: Rhett Allain</em></figcaption></div>\n<p>That&#x2019;s not the best picture, but the only one I could find. The brighter object is Venus. If the image had a better resolution, you would be able to see that Venus shows the same kind of phase that we see with the moon. What does this mean? It means two things. First, We can see Venus because it reflects light from the Sun. Second, as the phases change, Venus is sometimes closer to us that the Sun and sometimes farther away. You would see a &#x201C;full phase&#x201D; Venus when it is on the other side of the Sun. How can both Venus and the Sun orbit the Earth but also have Venus move farther away? Oh, this is something that Galileo saw with his telescope.</p>\n<p><strong>Moons of Jupiter</strong>. This is something else that Galileo did that you can repeat: see the moons of Jupiter. Again, you just need binoculars. Look at Jupiter it will look something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img alt=\"Catalog Page for Pia04532\" src=\"http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/catalog_page_for_pia04532.jpg\" width=\"631\"><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Image: NASA/JPL/Malin Space Science Systems</em></figcaption></div>\n<p><span>Well, it won&#x2019;t look quite like that. You will probably just see Jupiter as a dot without any details. But you WILL be able to see the 4 big moons of Jupiter. So what? The idea that all the planets (and the Sun) orbit the Earth isn&#x2019;t as strong once you show that there are objects that orbit another planet. These moons of Jupiter clearly orbit Jupiter and not the Earth.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Size and Angular Size of the Sun.</strong> Hold your thumb close to your eye (but not so close that you can&#x2019;t focus on it). Now hold your thumb out at arm&#x2019;s length. It looks smaller right? Of course it&#x2019;s still your same old thumb, but the angular size of an object changes as it moves farther away. In general, there are three things to consider: the length of the object (<em>L</em>), the distance from the observer to the object (<em>r</em>), and the angular size of the object (&#x3B8;). These three things are related in the following manner.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" alt=\"Calculating the Angular View of an i Phone   Wired Science\" src=\"http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/calculating_the_angular_view_of_an_i_phone_wired_science.jpg\" width=\"606\"></p>\n<p>Now, what about the Sun? If you look at it (which you should never do or you will hurt your eyes) you would see it has an angular size of 0.5&#xB0;. With this angular size, you can determine the size of the Sun for different distances. If the sun were the same size as the Earth, it would have to be 1.46 x 10<sup>9</sup> meters away. If it were the same distance that Venus is at it&#x2019;s closest approach, the Sun would be 26 times the width of Earth. Of course, the Sun is actually much farther than that as well as much bigger.</p>\n<p>In fact, the Greeks even tried to measure the distance to the Sun based on their measurement of the Earth and moon (<a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2009/12/rp-7-cool-things-the-greeks-did-in-astronomy/\">here are some other cool things the Greeks did</a>). Aristarchus found a Sun distance of 40 times that of the distance to the Moon. This would make the Sun also 40 times the size of the moon. His calculation was way off, but he still suggested that the Earth orbits the Sun because the Sun was so HUGE.</p>\n<p><strong>The View From Mars</strong>. Here is the sunset as seen by the Mars Pathfinder.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img alt=\"Pia07453 Modest jpg  920&#xD7;225 \" src=\"http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/pia07453_modest_jpg_920x225_.jpg\" width=\"660\"><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona</em></figcaption></div>\n<p><span>First, you might notice that the angular size of the Sun is smaller when viewed from Mars than when viewed from the Earth. This means that the Mars-Sun distance is greater than the Earth-Sun distance. Also, if you looked at the Sun throughout the orbit of Mars, it would mostly be the same angular size.</span></p>\n<p>Ok, I get it. You think this is silly because there is no way to get a lander on Mars without a heliocentric solar system model. Yes, that&#x2019;s an excellent point. But still, this IS evidence of a heliocentric model that you can figure out for yourself.</p>\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n</div><hr class=\"rdb-page-break\" /><div><div class=\"entry\">\n\t\t\t<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-152431\" title=\"2468719436_50863d77cf_b\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/wiredscience/2013/03/2468719436_50863d77cf_b-660x495.jpg\" width=\"660\"></p>\n<p>Tonight is Passover. And the most well-known food of the holiday is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matzo\">matzah</a>, the cracker-like flatbread. Within this food we can find some complexity science goodness.</p>\n<p>At one part of the Seder meal, we break one piece of matzah into half. Now, for anyone who has actually tried this, one recognizes the great difficulty in doing so. Matzah does not break evenly. It too often breaks along fracture points that cause a piece of matzah to break into small pieces, large pieces, and everything in between. If you&#x2019;re familiar with the principle of crackling noise and universality in physics, this should <a href=\"http://pages.physics.cornell.edu/~myers/teaching/ComputationalMethods/ComputerExercises/Percolation/Percolation.html\">sound familiar</a>.</p>\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-152429 aligncenter\" title=\"avalance\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/wiredscience/2013/03/avalance.png\" width=\"491\">There are many systems, that when tuned in a certain way, reach a critical threshold where something changes. For example, when ice melts or a magnet is heated to lose its magnetism, these things occur when a specific temperature is reached. But at that specific parameter&#x2019;s value&#x2014;such as zero degrees for ice&#x2014;the properties of the system can have a certain scale-free or self-similar nature.\n<p>For example, take the canonical example from <a href=\"http://pages.physics.cornell.edu/~myers/teaching/ComputationalMethods/ComputerExercises/Percolation/Percolation.html\">percolation theory</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Percolation theory is the study of the connectivity of networks. If you take a piece of paper and punch small holes in it at random positions, it will remain connected if the density of holes is small. If you punch so many holes that most of the paper has been punched away, the paper will fall apart into small clusters.</p>\n<p>There is a phase transition in percolation, where the paper first falls apart. Let p be the probability that a given spot in the paper has been punched away. There is a critical probability p_c below which the paper is still connected from top to bottom, and above which the paper has fallen into small pieces (say, if it is being held along the top edge).</p></blockquote>\n<p>At that critical value, below which everything is connected and above which the paper is in small pieces, you often get pieces of all sizes. Essentially, there is no <em>scale</em>&#x2014;it&#x2019;s scale free.</p>\n<p>And perhaps that&#x2019;s what&#x2019;s happening with matzah: a piece of matzah is in a carefully tuned critical state, allowing it to crack into pieces of all sizes. Further research and discussion is necessary, of course, and are both fitting topics for a Seder discussion.</p>\n<p>Happy Passover!</p>\n<p><em>Top image:<a href=\"https://secure.flickr.com/photos/ronalmog/2468719436/\">RomAlmog</a>/Flickr/CC</em></p>\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n</div>","related":{}},"28":{"title":"How Burrowing Owls Lead To Vomiting Anarchists (Or SFâ€™s Housing Crisis Explained)","content":"<div><div class=\"article-entry text l-featured-container\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n<p class=\"first\">The Santa Clara Valley was some of the most valuable agricultural land in the entire world, but it was paved over to create today&#x2019;s Silicon Valley.

I&#x2019;ve spent&#xA0;time&#xA0;looking&#xA0;into the city&#x2019;s historical housing and development policies. With the protests escalating again,&#xA0;I am pretty tired of seeing the city&#x2019;s young and disenfranchised fight each other&#xA0;amid&#xA0;an extreme housing shortage created by 30 to 40 years of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIMBY\">NIMBYism or (&#x201C;Not-In-My-Backyard-ism&#x201D;)</a> from the old wealth of the city <em>and </em>down from&#xA0;the&#xA0;peninsula suburbs.</p>\n<p>Here is&#xA0;a very long explainer. Sorry, this isn&#x2019;t a shorter post or that I didn&#x2019;t break it into 20 pieces. If you&#x2019;re wondering why people are protesting you, how we got to this housing crisis, why rent control exists or why tech is even shifting to San Francisco in the first place, this is meant to provide some common points of understanding.</p>\n<p>This is a complex problem, and I&#x2019;m not going to distill it into&#xA0;young, rich tech douchebags-versus-helpless old ladies facing eviction.&#xA0;There are many other places where you can&#xA0;read that story.</p>\n<p>It does&#xA0;us all no justice.</p>\n<p><strong>1) First off, understand the math of the&#xA0;region. </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/06/06075.html\">San Francisco has a roughly thirty-five percent homeownership rate.</a>&#xA0;Then&#xA0;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.spur.org/publications/article/2014-02-11/how-make-san-francisco-affordable-again\">172,000 units of the city&#x2019;s 376,940 housing units</a> are under rent control. (That&#x2019;s&#xA0;about 75 percent of the&#xA0;city&#x2019;s rental stock.)</p>\n<p>Homeowners have a strong economic incentive to restrict supply because it supports price appreciation of their own homes. It&#x2019;s understandable. Many of them have&#xA0;put the bulk of their net worth into their homes and they don&#x2019;t want to lose that. So they engage in NIMBYism under the name&#xA0;of preservationism or environmentalism, even though denying in-fill development here creates pressures for sprawl elsewhere. They do this through hundreds of&#xA0;politically powerful neighborhood groups throughout San Francisco&#xA0;like the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.thd.org/\">Telegraph Hill Dwellers</a>.</p>\n<p>Then the rent-controlled&#xA0;tenants care far more about eviction protections than increasing supply. That&#x2019;s because their most vulnerable constituents are paying rents that are so far below market-rate, that only an ungodly amount of construction could possibly help them. Plus, that construction wouldn&#x2019;t happen fast enough &#x2014; especially for elderly tenants.</p>\n<p>So we&#x2019;re looking at as much as 80 percent&#xA0;of the city that isn&#x2019;t&#xA0;naturally&#xA0;oriented&#xA0;to add to the housing stock.</p>\n<p>Oh, and&#xA0;tech? The industry is about&#xA0;8 percent of San Francisco&#x2019;s workforce.</p>\n<p>Then if you look at&#xA0;the cities down on the peninsula and in&#xA0;the traditional heart of Silicon Valley, where home-ownership rates are higher, it&#x2019;s&#xA0;even worse.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_988194\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img class=\"wp-image-988194 size-full\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/441px-burrowing_owl_4354.jpg?w=441&amp;h=600\" alt=\"The true culprit behind our housing problems: let us deflect blame to Mountain View's burrowing owl!\" width=\"441\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The true culprit behind our housing problems: let us deflect blame to Mountain View&#x2019;s burrowing owl!

(The city council even<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mercurynews.com/education/ci_25483424/mountain-view-council-calls-feral-cat-taskforce\">&#xA0;created a feral cat taskforce last week to&#xA0;protect&#xA0;the owls</a>.)</p>\n<p>Even more mind-bogglingly, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mv-voice.com/news/2014/04/11/city-poised-for-unprecedented-office-growth\">Mountain View&#xA0;is discussing new office development that would bring as many as</a><span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mv-voice.com/news/2014/04/11/city-poised-for-unprecedented-office-growth\">&#xA0;42,550 office workers to&#xA0;the city. But the city&#x2019;s zoning&#xA0;plan only allows for a maximum of 7,000 new homes by 2030</a>.&#xA0;</span></p>\n<p>Then, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_24462926/early-tally-shows-measure-d-senior-housing-project\">if you look at the job-to-housing ratios in some of the other peninsula cities like Palo Alto, it&#x2019;s pretty terrible. Palo Alto voters just killed an affordable housing development for seniors</a>&#xA0;by ballot measure last November.</p>\n<p>So the wealthy voting classes of the peninsula&#xA0;are also&#xA0;strangling themselves of housing too.&#xA0;The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.zillow.com/mountain-view-ca/home-values/\">median rent&#xA0;in Mountain View is $2,700</a> compared to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.zillow.com/san-francisco-ca/home-values/\">$3,400 in San Francisco</a>, according to Zillow. Once you factor in the cost of owning a car &#x2014; estimated at slightly more than $9,000 a year by the AAA &#x2014; it&#x2019;s not that much cheaper.</p>\n<p>If you look even closer to the Caltrain stations, rents go way up. The newly-opened Madera complex in downtown Mountain View <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.prometheusreg.com/san-francisco-properties/madera\">rents out 1-bedroom units starting at $3,299 all the way up to 2-bedroom apartments at $8,000 per month.</a></p>\n<p>Certain cities like&#xA0;Menlo Park seem more collaborative. Facebook&#xA0;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/business/bottomline/article/Facebook-partner-to-build-Menlo-Park-housing-4860826.php\">partnered with developer St. Anton Partners to build a 394-unit complex within walking distance of its Menlo Park headquarters</a>. But that&#x2019;s 394 units for a company with more than 6,000 employees.</p>\n<p>So one contributor to the tech industry&#x2019;s spread into&#xA0;San&#xA0;Francisco is that the peninsula cities are more than happy to vote for jobs, just not homes.</p>\n<p><strong>2) Why is the tech industry migrating to cities anyway?</strong></p>\n<p>This is a demographic&#xA0;shift that is much larger&#xA0;than the technology industry itself &#x2014; although there are some tech-specific reasons that have fueled a&#xA0;migration&#xA0;north from the historic heart of Silicon Valley over the last 10 years.</p>\n<p>This is&#xA0;what&#xA0;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Great-Inversion-Future-American-Vintage/dp/0307474372\">urbanist Alan&#xA0;Ehrenhalt calls &#x201C;The Great Inversion,&#x201D;</a>&#xA0;a major shift where cities and suburbs have traded places over the last&#xA0;30&#xA0;to 40 years.&#xA0;As people marry later and employment becomes more temporal, young adults and affluent retirees are moving into the urban core, while immigrants and the less affluent are moving out.</p>\n<p>San Francisco&#x2019;s population hit a trough&#xA0;around 1980, after steadily declining since the 1950s&#xA0;as&#xA0;the city&#x2019;s socially conservative white and Irish-Catholic population left for the suburbs.&#xA0;Into the vacuum of relatively cheaper&#xA0;rents they left behind, came the misfits, hippies and immigrants that fomented so many of San Francisco&#x2019;s&#xA0;beautifully weird cultural and sexual&#xA0;revolutions.</p>\n<p>But that out-migration&#xA0;reversed around 1980, and the city&#x2019;s population&#xA0;has been steadily rising for the last 30 years.</p>\n<p>This is a phenomenon&#xA0;that&#x2019;s&#xA0;happening to cities all over the United States.</p>\n<p>It&#x2019;s happening in Seattle, Atlanta, New York City, Boston and Washington. D.C.:</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n<p>Its rapacious speed may even be&#xA0;accelerating. Witness&#xA0;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://vanishingnewyork.blogspot.com/2014/03/on-spike-lee-hyper-gentrification.html\">hyper-gentrification</a>&#xA0;in&#xA0;Brooklyn and Manhattan, or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/10561607/Why-this-Shoreditchification-of-London-must-stop.html\">the &#x201C;Shoreditch-ification&#x201D; of London</a>.</p>\n<p>Why?</p>\n<p>People are getting married later and are living longer.&#xA0;Nearly 50 percent of Americans, or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/facts_for_features_special_editions/cb13-ff21.html\">more than 100 million&#xA0;people&#xA0;are&#xA0;unmarried&#xA0;today</a>, up from around 22 percent in 1950.</p>\n<p>The job market has changed as well. In 1978, the U.S.&#x2019;s&#xA0;manufacturing employment peaked and the noise and grit of the blue-collar factories that once fueled the flight of the upper-middle-class disappeared. These vacant manufacturing warehouses&#xA0;turned&#xA0;into the live-work spaces and lofts that emerged in the 1980s and 1990s in cities like New York and San Francisco.</p>\n<p>The concept of lifetime employment also faded.&#xA0;Today, San Francisco&#x2019;s younger&#xA0;workers&#xA0;derive&#xA0;their&#xA0;job security not from any single employer but instead from&#xA0;a large network of weak ties that lasts from one company to the next. The density&#xA0;of cities favors this job-hopping behavior more than the relative isolation of suburbia.</p>\n\n<p>There are also some&#xA0;tech industry-specific reasons too.&#xA0;The capital costs required to found&#xA0;a company and&#xA0;launch&#xA0;a minimum viable product are much lower than a decade ago. Startups also need fewer people, especially with the low distribution costs&#xA0;provided&#xA0;by platforms like Apple&#x2019;s iOS app store or Facebook. So it&#x2019;s easier for lots of small companies&#xA0;to find pockets of commercial real estate in the city for new offices. It&#x2019;s also easier for VCs to fund an order of magnitude more experiments, even if the same proportion of them fails.</p>\n<p>The products&#xA0;that technology companies are making today are also&#xA0;different.&#xA0;In&#xA0;the 1970s, &#x201C;Silicon Valley&#x201D; literally meant making semiconductors&#xA0;in large fabs that required expensive equipment and clean rooms.</p>\n<p>But the&#xA0;big wave of the last decade has been social networking. And every notable consumer web or mobile product of this wave&#xA0;has been&#xA0;seeded through critical mass&#xA0;in the &#x201C;analog&#x201D;&#xA0;world.&#xA0;Facebook had university campuses. Snapchat had Southern California high schools. Foursquare had Lower Manhattan. Twitter had San Francisco. <em>These products favor&#xA0;social density.</em></p>\n<p>An&#xA0;even newer&#xA0;generation of startups addresses distinctly&#xA0;urban&#xA0;questions. Airbnb exists because in 2007, San Francisco <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2012/05/03/airbnb-apartments-social-media/\">didn&#x2019;t have&#xA0;enough hotel capacity&#xA0;to house visitors in town for an industrial design conference</a>. Uber exists because the&#xA0;city&#x2019;s taxi market was under-supplied with drivers and smartphones offered a new way of summoning&#xA0;transportation on demand.&#xA0;Then there are very young startups like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://buildcampus.com/\">Campus</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://buildcampus.com/\">which&#xA0;is like a&#xA0;venture-backed communal living movement</a>,&#xA0;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://leaptransit.com/\">Leap Transit</a>, which is trying to shake up&#xA0;scheduled transport, or any of the companies out of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tumml.org/#mission-1\">Tumml</a>, an urban ventures&#xA0;incubator.</p>\n<p>As&#xA0;tech workers have moved into&#xA0;cities, the industry has changed San Francisco&#x2019;s&#xA0;culture and San Francisco has changed the technology industry.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, while&#xA0;tech is&#xA0;fueling San&#xA0;Francisco&#x2019;s current boom and has helped cut the city&#x2019;s unemployment rate by about half since 2010, this gentrification wave has been going on for&#xA0;decades&#xA0;longer than the&#xA0;word &#x201C;dot-com&#x201D; has existed.</p>\n<p>And it&#x2019;s happening all over the&#xA0;country.</p>\n<p>So&#xA0;a&#xA0;great question of our time is how American cities handle&#xA0;this shift. They have to do this&#xA0;in the face of global economic&#xA0;changes that are&#xA0;dividing&#xA0;our workforce into highly-skilled knowledge workers who&#xA0;are&#xA0;disproportionately benefiting from growth&#xA0;and lower-skilled service workers that are not seeing their wages rise at all.</p>\n<p><strong>3) OK, let&#x2019;s build more housing!</strong></p>\n<p>Y Combinator partner Garry Tan tweeted out a map the other week:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><p>Want to see why SF housing is so expensive?

Mislabeled by some detractors as socialist or radical in the Marxist tradition, San Francisco&#x2019;s progressivism is concerned with consumption more than production, residence more than workplace, meaning more than materialism, community empowerment more than class struggle. Its first priority is not revolution but protection &#x2014; protection of the city&#x2019;s environment, architectural heritage, neighborhoods, diversity, and overall quality of life from the radical transformations of turbulent American capitalism.</p></blockquote>\n<p>While we have to thank these movements for preserving so much of the land surrounding San Francisco&#xA0;and the city&#x2019;s beautiful Victorians, one side&#xA0;effect is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.spur.org/publications/article/2014-02-11/how-make-san-francisco-affordable-again\">that the city&#xA0;has added an average of 1,500 units per year</a> for the last 20 years.&#xA0;Meanwhile, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/06/06075.html\">the U.S. Census&#xA0;estimates that&#xA0;the city&#x2019;s population grew by&#xA0;32,000 people from 2010 to 2013</a>&#xA0;alone.</p>\n<p>Even today, you can see these factions engaging in behavior that might seem absurd in the context of&#xA0;a housing shortage.</p>\n<p><em>Exhibit A: Rich, Non-Tech People Trying&#xA0;To Downzone The Waterfront Amid An Acute Housing Crisis</em></p>\n<p>On the ballot this June, is&#xA0;an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nowallonthewaterfront.com/\">initiative</a> that will require voters to individually approve height limit exemptions for developments on the city&#x2019;s waterfront.&#xA0;It jeopardizes three major&#xA0;projects including the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nba.com/warriors/sf\">Warriors stadium (pictured below)</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://pier70sf.com/\">a plan to turn Pier 70 into a mixed-use development with office space and apartments.</a></p>\n<p>Those developments are slated to&#xA0;deliver as much as 3,690&#xA0;housing units and $124 million in affordable housing fees, according to a memo&#xA0;written by John Arntz, the director&#xA0;of&#xA0;the city&#x2019;s department of elections.&#xA0;This initiative is funded overwhelmingly by a&#xA0;<em>non-tech&#xA0;</em>couple&#xA0;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://nf4.netfile.com/Pub2/AllFilingsByMeasure.aspx?id=149077385&amp;measure=Measure+B+-+Waterfront+Height+Limit+Initiative\">named Barbara and Richard Stewart</a>, who gave $75,000.

He was already on the hook to pay $1.4 million in city-mandated impact fees, yet the community got him to agree to much more.

Next, Givas donated $1 million for the Texas-based Alamo Drafthouse Cinema chain to renovate the long-shuttered New Mission Theater next door into a five-screen dinner-and-a-movie cineplex.

The city also requires extensive public notice of proposed projects even if they already meet neighborhood plans, which have taken several years of deliberation to produce. Neighbors can appeal your project for something as insignificant as the shade of paint, although the city&#x2019;s planning department and commission tries to get through minor appeals quickly.</p>\n<p>If those fail, neighborhood groups can also file a CEQA or environmental lawsuit under California state law, challenging the environment impact of the project. Perversely, CEQA lawsuits have been&#xA0;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/opinion/editorials/article/CEQA-reform-bill-falls-short-4739672.php\">used to challenge a city plan to add 34 miles of bike lanes</a>.</p>\n<p>Then if that fails, opponents can put a development directly on a citywide ballot with enough signatures.

It also means that&#xA0;developers have problems attracting capital financing in weaker economic years because of the political uncertainty around getting a project passed.</p>\n<p>The sophistication with which neighborhood groups wield San Francisco&#x2019;s arcane land-use and zoning regulations for activist purposes is one of the very unique things about the city&#x2019;s politics.</p>\n<p>But the city&#x2019;s political leadership doesn&#x2019;t want to change it, because it fears backlash from powerful neighborhood groups, which actually deliver votes.</p>\n<p><strong>5) Also, parts&#xA0;of the progressive community do not believe in supply and demand.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, I was&#xA0;surprised by this.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We can&#x2019;t build our way to affordability,&#x201D; is a common refrain.

It is not means-tested, meaning anyone from well-salaried, white-collar workers to very low-income residents can benefit from it. It also forces a number of small-time, mom-and-pop landlords to individually subsidize someone else&#x2019;s cost of living in the city.</p>\n<p>It creates two classes of tenants &#x2014; one that is very legally protected and another that is not.

In&#xA0;studies of other cities where rent control unexpectedly ended via a change in state law&#xA0;like&#xA0;Cambridge, Massachusetts, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/w18125.pdf?new_window=1\">tenants in these apartments&#xA0;had lower incomes than those of market-rate renters.</a></p>\n<p>San Francisco&#x2019;s version of rent control&#xA0;also&#xA0;does not apply to buildings constructed after 1979, so it shouldn&#x2019;t dis-incentivize developers from producing new units.</p>\n<p>Instead, <em>a lot</em> of other factors are constricting supply.&#xA0;That said, I do think it undermines the political will that would otherwise exist for building more housing.</p>\n<p><strong>10)&#xA0;</strong><strong>So a highly-restricted housing supply +&#xA0;rising demand + a volatile local economy prone to booms and busts + strict rent control without vacancy control = Eviction crisis every decade!&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-983783\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/screen-shot-2014-04-04-at-1-15-35-pm.png?w=680&amp;h=359\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2014-04-04 at 1.15.35 PM\" width=\"680\"></p>\n<p>San Francisco&#x2019;s version of rent control&#xA0;lacks vacancy controls, which means landlords can re-set rents at whatever the market will bear&#xA0;when new rent-controlled tenants move in.</p>\n<p>The logic is that with&#xA0;vacancy controls, landlords won&#x2019;t invest in maintaining their properties.&#xA0;But the flipside is that the landlord also has&#xA0;a strong financial incentive to evict longstanding tenants who&#xA0;are paying below-market rates.</p>\n<p>So every decade during a boom, there is a tragic, elderly face for the story of displacement.</p>\n<p>This past year, it was&#xA0;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/S-F-family-loses-fight-evicted-after-34-years-4920650.php\">Gum Gee Lee and&#xA0;Poon Heung Lee</a>, the elderly Chinese-American couple with a mentally disabled daughter who were evicted last fall from their home of 34 years.

This is one reason for why the&#xA0;biotechnology industry has&#xA0;historically been&#xA0;centered in South San Francisco with companies like&#xA0;Genentech, even though&#xA0;San Francisco is home to UCSF, one of the best medical schools and research facilities in the world.</p>\n<p>At the time that the city passed both exclusions, San Francisco was<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sfcontroller.org/Modules/ShowDocument.aspx?documentid=788\"> the only city in the state of California to&#xA0;derive all of&#xA0;its business tax revenue&#xA0;from payrolls</a> and one of the few in the nation that taxed employee stock options.</p>\n<p>Other&#xA0;cities in Silicon Valley like Palo Alto and Mountain View had almost non-existent business tax burdens.&#xA0;Mountain View&#xA0;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mountainview.gov/city_hall/admin_services/business_licenses.asp\">just charges an annual&#xA0;fee ranging from $30 to $100</a>, while&#xA0;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cityofpaloalto.org/civicax/filebank/documents/28930\">Palo Alto has a one-time $413 fee for a&#xA0;certificate of use&#xA0;and occupancy</a>. Both cities are more&#xA0;dependent on&#xA0;property&#xA0;and sales taxes.&#xA0;If Twitter<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sfcontroller.org/Modules/ShowDocument.aspx?documentid=1865\">&#xA0;moved to&#xA0;South San Francisco&#xA0;at that time, the company&#xA0;would have paid that city government&#xA0;$15 per employee per year, or $37,500 a year for 2,500&#xA0;employees.</a></p>\n<p>So&#xA0;this uncapped, unpredictable tax liability that could stretch into tens of millions of dollars&#xA0;was a huge reason to leave&#xA0;even though Twitter&#x2019;s&#xA0;leadership wanted to stay. At the same time,&#xA0;San Francisco&#x2019;s unemployment rate was north of 8 percent at that time, so the city&#x2019;s priority was to create jobs.</p>\n<p><strong>The Mid-Market payroll tax exclusion (a.k.a. &#x201C;Twitter tax break&#x201D;) will be a moot point by 2018 when the city shifts entirely to a&#xA0;gross receipts tax.&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><p>The new <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/twitter\">@twitter</a> HQ sign is an homage to the civic importance of its predecessor.

The argument was that payroll&#xA0;taxes penalize job creation.&#xA0;On top of that, the city was only collecting the payroll taxes from&#xA0;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sfcontroller.org/Modules/ShowDocument.aspx?documentid=3426\">less than 10 percent of the roughly 100,000&#xA0;registered companies</a>&#xA0;in the city at that time.</p>\n<p>A&#xA0;gross receipts tax focuses on revenues; it&#x2019;s generally good for service businesses like restaurants and pre-revenue companies that could scale quickly like tech startups. The city used to charge either the greater of a gross receipts tax or a payroll tax, but the California state court system ruled that this was illegal after <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.caltax.org/inthenews/los_angeles_daily_news_5-22-00.htm\">companies like Eastman Kodak and General Motors sued the city of Los Angeles for the same practice more than a decade ago.</a>&#xA0;The city <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.smartvoter.org/2000/11/07/ca/sf/meas/I/\">had tried to&#xA0;shift from a payroll tax to a gross receipts tax before,</a> but the measure&#xA0;didn&#x2019;t pass until 2012.</p>\n<p>So this whole&#xA0;tax break that people are screaming about will be a moot point by 2018,&#xA0;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sftreasurer.org/sites/sftreasurer.org/files/Gross-Receipts-Tax-Presentation-Feb-2014.pdf\">when the gross receipts tax is fully&#xA0;baked in for everyone.</a></p>\n<p>And if San&#xA0;Francisco is able to convince tech companies to stay instead of moving down south to the peninsula, and one of them turns into a Facebook, Oracle or Google-sized company, the city will be able to capture a percentage of what will be billions of dollars in annual revenues.</p>\n<p>The city said today that the program had already <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sfmayor.org/index.aspx?recordid=545&amp;page=846\">helped generate $8.4 million</a> in property and real estate transfer taxes, attracted 18 tech companies and convinced 17 small businesses to open on the street.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_986049\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-986049 size-full\" src=\"http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/screen-shot-2014-04-10-at-12-35-25-am.png?w=625&amp;h=422\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2014-04-10 at 12.35.25 AM\" width=\"625\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Mid-Market payroll tax exclusion zone.

They then parlayed the equity from that home into buying homes of their own when they were ready to&#xA0;start families.</p>\n<p>We have to remember that cities are unequal because the opportunities they provide attract&#xA0;<em>both</em>&#xA0;the very rich and the very poor.</p>\n<p>San Francisco&#x2019;s&#xA0;extreme&#xA0;juxtapositions of wealth and&#xA0;poverty exist because the city is both an extremely desirable place to live <em>and</em>&#xA0;it maintains&#xA0;protections for residents&#xA0;through programs like rent control <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Expanded-services-for-homeless-people-5341198.php\">and $165 million a year</a>&#xA0;in spending on&#xA0;homelessness.</p>\n<p>The&#xA0;gleaming, onyx&#xA0;NEMA towers&#xA0;exist side-by-side with homelessness because San&#xA0;Francisco created the Mid-Market program to lure companies like Twitter&#xA0;<em>and&#xA0;</em>the&#xA0;single-room-occupancy hotels and non-profits that house and feed the city&#x2019;s&#xA0;poorest residents&#xA0;have been politically protected&#xA0;in the Tenderloin&#xA0;for decades.</p>\n<p>Both the tech industry and San Francisco have delicate ecologies that have taken decades to cultivate. As they&#xA0;become more intertwined,&#xA0;the political winds of the city are shifting. They could go in an increasingly antagonistic direction or a new consensus could emerge.</p>\n<p>What will it be?</p>\n<p><strong>Tech workers:&#xA0;</strong>It&#x2019;s not as easy as just building up.&#xA0;This battle has been raging on since the sand dunes of the Sunset district were flattened for single-family homes in the 1950s.</p>\n<p>Try to understand where others&#xA0;are coming from. There are people out there like Mary Elizabeth Phillips, who could really use your help <em>right now,&#xA0;</em>whether that means <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.sfciti.com/news/newsletters/stop-evictions-in-sf-by-supporting-ellis-act-reform-in-sf\">signing a petition for Ellis Act reform</a>, calling or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:David@urbangreeninv.com\">e-mailing Urban Green</a>, or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.antievictionmappingproject.net/pledge/\">boycotting Ellis Act eviction properties</a>.</p>\n<p>How can your actions where you live benefit others who are losing out during this economic boom?</p>\n<p>How will you participate in your community?&#xA0;Will it be through charity?&#xA0;Through volunteership?&#xA0;Through taxes?</p>\n<p>Are you willing to fight the political battles and form the alliances necessary to create&#xA0;housing&#xA0;for tech workers and teachers alike? You need to vote, to show&#xA0;the city government that there is political will for&#xA0;development or else the old, anti-growth regime will keep dictating preservationist&#xA0;policies that turn housing into a zero-sum game.</p>\n<p>Companies like Gap, Wells Fargo, Levi Strauss &amp; Co. and Salesforce also have long histories of participating in San Francisco&#x2019;s civic life. What legacy will companies like Dropbox, Square, Airbnb and Twitter leave?</p>\n<p><strong>Homeowners in the neighborhood associations and in the peninsula:</strong> The tech industry is helping your home values skyrocket, but your property taxes have not kept up with the cost of providing services or schools.</p>\n<p>Stop sitting in the background while the city&#x2019;s workers, the poor, the elderly and its young duke out in this ugly charade.</p>\n<p>While there are some tech workers who do&#xA0;strike it rich, most just have&#xA0;salaries&#xA0;and would love&#xA0;to raise families in the Bay Area just as you did when you came here years ago.</p>\n<p>The Bay Area risks becoming&#xA0;a victim of its own success if it can&#x2019;t make more room. At this point, blocking individual&#xA0;housing developments to protect your views is tantamount to generational theft.</p>\n<p><strong>Activists:&#xA0;</strong>Invoking CEQA clauses to&#xA0;stall the city&#x2019;s tech shuttle program&#xA0;through an environmental impact review so that 1,400 of 4,000 tech bus riders&#xA0;may or may not&#xA0;decide to move slightly south is not&#xA0;a game-changing way to address&#xA0;housing affordability&#xA0;in San Francisco.</p>\n<p>The industry&#x2019;s leadership like Conway are asking tech companies to back Ellis Act reform.</p>\n<p>But without serious additions to the entire region&#x2019;s housing supply, these crisis measures just make San Francisco&#x2019;s existing middle- and working-class a highly-protected, but endangered population in the long-run. With such limited&#xA0;rental stock&#xA0;available&#xA0;on the market at any time, what kind of&#xA0;person&#xA0;can afford to move here today when <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.trulia.com/trends/2014/04/price-and-rent-monitors-mar-2014/\">the city&#x2019;s median rent is $3,350?</a></p>\n<p>For the more extreme groups, you cannot logically fight both development and displacement. The real estate speculation running through the city right now is just as much a bet on political paralysis in the face of&#xA0;a long-term&#xA0;housing shortage as it is on San Francisco&#x2019;s desirability as a place to live.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the antagonism only ensures that deals will happen behind closed doors. The unfortunate path of least resistance for most tech companies will be to just pay their workers more, instead of engaging in regional politics. That is a loss for everyone.</p>\n<p>For the more pragmatic groups, the tech community could easily be persuaded to support inclusionary housing, provided the numbers still work out profitably for developers and that lots more overall housing units gets built. The same goes for Trinity-like projects.</p>\n<p><strong>In conclusion:&#xA0;</strong>The crisis we&#x2019;re seeing is the result of decades of choices, and while the tech industry is a sexy, attention-grabbing target, it cannot shoulder blame for this alone.</p>\n<p>Unless a new direction emerges, this will keep getting worse until the next economic crash, and then it will re-surface again eight years later. Or it will keep spilling over into Oakland, which is a whole other&#xA0;Pandora&#x2019;s box of gentrification issues.</p>\n<p>The high housing costs aren&#x2019;t&#xA0;healthy for the city, nor&#xA0;are they&#xA0;healthy for the industry. Both thrive on a constant flow of ideas and people.</p>\n<p>So while Google may not be opening a giant office in Detroit anytime soon, the people of Detroit and the Midwest are coming here.</p>\n<p>I meet them every day.</p>\n<p>There are&#xA0;people like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/blaurenceclark\">Brian Clark</a>, who actually did move from Detroit,&#xA0;and was living off various hackathon winnings <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/05/missionbit/\">while teaching coding&#xA0;in MissionBit&#x2019;s after-school programs</a> for&#xA0;San&#xA0;Francisco&#x2019;s public school students. Earlier this spring, he was literally&#xA0;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.brianlaurence.com/blog/i-cant-stop/\">sleeping on friends&#x2019; couches, eating one meal a day</a>. But he&#xA0;won the Launch Hackathon and now has initial funding for a new startup called&#xA0;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://getvue.co/\">Vue</a>, a&#xA0;mobile feedback and user engagement tool he built.</p>\n<p>Or like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/reyfaustino\">Rey Faustino</a>, who I wrote about last month. He grew up in a working-class family in Southern California that relied on social services&#xA0;to make ends meet. Now he&#x2019;s working on fixing&#xA0;the problems he remembered as a child through One Degree,&#xA0;which is a Yelp-like platform that helps Bay Area families&#xA0;<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/20/yc-backed-one-degree-is-a-yelp-for-social-services-that-helps-low-income-families/\">find the right non-profits and social services for them. It&#x2019;s supported&#xA0;by Y Combinator and has thousands of users.&#xA0;</a></p>\n<p>Many of the people who come here&#xA0;will stay, and make vital contributions for decades through their work, their taxes and their charitable contributions. Some will come for awhile and then go back and invigorate entrepreneurial ecosystems back home. This circulation of creative talent is crucial not only for the Bay Area, but for the rest of the United States.</p>\n<p>I would not want to deny anyone &#x2014; rich or poor &#x2014; the chance to transform or be transformed by this place.</p>\n<p><small>Top image: A hearse rolls up to a Yahoo bus at the BART MacArthur Station in Oakland.
